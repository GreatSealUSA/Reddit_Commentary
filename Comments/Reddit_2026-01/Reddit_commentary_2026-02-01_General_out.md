Literally no one’s cares Jaknob. I’ve seen so many men with pretty much a like for like bio/full thesis on why women with kids are the “absolute drain of society” etc. It’s hard for them to think outside of that hate filled box so all spew the same, it’s actually giving mommy issues

As someone who once ODed on Benadryl, i was constantly taking to this guy who was walking right with me. Having full on conversations just for me to turn around and for him to vanish. 
I didn't see a hat man but there was always a familiar presence with whom I was talking to who periodically vanishes when I turn around.

Someone is hand filling a 20 gauge shotgun shell with Benadryl.

The joke here is, he is going to shoot an overdose of Benadryl at home invaders, so that they’re both wounded, and overdose a delirium shadow demon that people refer to seeing when they overdose.

Ok. So this is a play on the home\-intruder defence / Home Alone antics that often involves setting up shotgun shells to fire at intruders.

Home\-made shrapnel solutions such as nails and rock salt are common constituents for such improvised explosive devices.

In this case OP is dosing theirs with Benadryl. Overdosing on this can have weird and unpleasant side effects such as hallucinations and disappearing to a pocket dimension.

Notice around that time the Andrew scandal was starting to leak out, the Meghan hate campaign was brutal in the British press? Harry said his wife became sucidal and knew that they were being used as scape goats and he had no option but to leave to save his family.

Whenever you see Harry and Meghan hate know that the Andrew and Fergie's team are behind it.

Britain is just as Racist as America, the Brits just are good at pretending but not anymore as Reform continues to gain momentum.

You guys are unhinged. 

He was invited (amongst other prominent people) to a premier. Probably happened hundreds of times from hundreds of publicity teams. 

There's zero evidence that Rowling associated with him. 

You can do better.

Oof! I commented in that thread, but I guess I was too early to witness the shitstorm that followed. I was pretty impressed with the photo, myself. It's an angle of aviation that we rarely get to see, aside from when a plane appears a Google Maps tile, which often are too blurry. A real picture is a hundred times better

I’m a pilot with the RCAF’s Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team. I tried to post some cool pictures of our off\-season training a few weeks ago. Those were taken in\-flight with a vintage analog camera. They were immediately taken down for no reason… I haven’t bothered trying to post anything since, to be honest.

His point about Arc Raiders not being an e\-sports or competitive title is 100% accurate. There are certain games that are designed to be "sweaty" and cater to ranked play, etc. Arc Raiders is not one of them. It's an entirely casual game. The only way to make this game competitive would be to remove all the RNG aspects of it, which would essentially transform the game into something else entirely.

Let this game be what it is: casual fun. The game already has AGMM to let you get into "sweaty" PvP lobbies if you so choose.

The people asking for this to become an actual competitive game are missing the point of an extraction shooter with massive RNG elements to it.

No, don’t ban a medicine saving the lives of morbidly obese people. It’s not the faults of the people who use it correctly under the supervision of a reputable a doctor. Unless the doctor is being bribed no reputable doctor would give it to a non diabetic with a healthy BMI. To ban things because celebs with eating disorders are getting thinner is insane. Don’t punish the millions of people who are obese and finally being able to lose weight for vain rich girls who cheat the system.

The claim sounds damning, like a muckraking headline or clickbait. It makes her sound like maybe she's not smart, but no one can explain Trinity.

It's a joke because you can define the trinity, but there's almost no way to explain the Holy Trinity without committing heresy. That's why they describe it as a Divine mystery.

Furthermore we wouldn't expect a Pop Star like Sabrina Carpenter to have the answer, making the accusation itself is even more absurd.

Its actually kind of funny.

I just paid $4300 for my daughter to have a 5 minute endoscopy, on top of another $1700 that I had to pay last year when she had an emergency. Completely emptied out any health savings account money we had. Without insurance these would have cost me over $40,000\. MURICA

The important takeaway of this video isn't how that China is amazing. 

This kind of experience, to a somewhat lesser degree, is basically universal all over the globe. It might not take 19minutes and cost 12usd, but perhaps 60minutes and cost 25usd.

The important takeaway is how China and THE WHOLE WORLD differs from the madness that is the US health care system!

My father in law is Chinese and is currently having cancer treatment in China. This video is VERY misleading with its implications. You’ll notice how she was asked if she wanted “Normal” or “Expert” care. That’s a REALLY important distinction. China’s medical system is cheap and quick, so it’s fine for minor illnesses. Anything significant though and you’re screwed unless you are very rich or happen to personally know the doctor treating you at the hospital. My father in law is poor but luckily his doctor is a childhood friend of his, so he gets disproportionately adequate care despite being poor. Nursing in China is considered a bad job; for people who aren’t smart enough to go to a good school, so the quality of nurses is very bad. Bribes are important for proper care, just like in China’s education system. Don’t bribe your doctor enough and you’re taking a major risk that they won’t prioritize you. My wife has spent a lot of money on “gifts” to send back to China for my mother in law to give to the staff treating my FIL. Hospitals don’t provide food for patients, so my MIL has to spend two hours a day riding the bus back and forth to bring him food. My wife went to visit him recently and pretty much everyday someone at their small hospital was told that they wouldn’t receive lifesaving medical care because they were too poor to afford it. All around very depressing stuff. There’s a reason China’s ultra wealthy seek medical care overseas if they are able to do so.

TLDR: China is alright for minor illnesses, but unless you’re extremely rich or lucky, for anything serious it is not a good medical system

So, in your first paragraph, do you mean that your wife has worn white to someone else's wedding BEFORE this time? Man, you need to rethink who you're married to. And she's this mad over you not being in the wedding party? I hope you don't have kids. You need to do a Homer\-Simpson\-back\-into\-the\-hedge meme out of your marriage.

South Park has made some parodies of political/infamous figures or events in the past. The Epstein files is a treasure trove of grave misconduct by such individuals. More importantly, it provides SP authors with a lot of source\-accurate content to parody.

In mangas panels are read right to left showing the tall woman grabbing the ball and giving it back to the child. Overseas panels are generally read left to right which in this case shows the tall woman taking a ball from a child and putting it up in a tree making the child cry.

I’ve never looked at my little baby and thought that I should have gone through with it. I should’ve never made that appointment to begin with and I hate myself for doing it everyday but I did do it and I can’t change that. Where those comments from him pop up is when we are discussing finances or how we are going to make space in another child’s room so their able to share one day and he tells me “this wouldn’t have been a problem if you just went through it.” So yes I remind him that he’s the one who assured me that I was right to not want one and to cancel the appointment after he spoke with his friend. And truthfully, I would’ve never done it anyway. I’ve lost several pregnancies in my lifetime and I could never purposely end one.
Also we did have a dna test. Both in utero and out. He knows he’s the father.

Post Title:      Non-Americans on Reddit today  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
A lot of Americans feel this way too. It's gotta be one of the most over\-hyped events ever.

> A huge number of Americans think Trump is bad and terrible, "bad bunny Trump", "bad man", and as Vince Gilligan spelled out February 15, 2025... https://Variety.com/2025/tv/news/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-good-guys-walter-white-1236309604/ Breaking Bad is cool. Walter White is cool. Following hate leaders is popular now.

> * Texan Rick Roderick: "And this sense of the sort of hyperreality we get with cinema, we get with television and so on is another phenomenon Baudrillard wants to examine. And I think that here we get – and, I mean, I guess my politics are showing again – but here we get the phenomenon of Reagan, the hyperreal president. More real than real. I mean he’s better at being Harry Truman than Harry Truman. I mean, the distinction about what he is is lost in the hyperreality of his smile, which like the Cheshire Cat’s, you know, just gleams across his face. And we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. **When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them**. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. Show business figures had this same thing go on for years." - https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Am I the only one here who remembers people being mad at all the terrible bugs, the fact that’s the game just ends, no broken steel like dlc, the bland map, early game railroading. I knew of lot of people who initially preferred fallout 3 who now say New Vegas is their favorite.

Linux is more accessible than ever before. You just have to "dare" to start using Linux. I speak from my own recent experience.

I have been a Windows user for 34 years and have now tried out a few "Linux" things on a test device. After 34 years of Windows, I will be switching my main system to Linux in the next few days.

Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 public education people since October 3, 2017 needs to be a WORLD WIDE WEB initiative to cult deprogram Russia and USA. Putin and Trump and Putin and Musk need to be addressed through the teaching and education of Dr. Bandy X Lee. And people need to face the social media behavior of AVOIDING nonfiction authors. Casually calling people { mentally unwell, crazy, batshit crazy, insane, clowns (constant, not just "clowning") } as techniques of { domination, though-terminating, insulting, mocking, mockery, bullying } needs to come to an end. Hate is a threat to all humanity as a viral cult behavior.

That is all bullshit. This is just a liquid gas mine.

This is not a manufactured firework. It is a heavy metal tube with a small black powder and titanium sponge (the sparks you see, it helps ensure complete combustion of the fuel) charge at the bottom then you fill it up with gasoline.

Quick edit, This is what a 1200 gallon fireball looks like. Shot by Bill Corbet "The Fireball Dudes" at PGI 2019 [https://youtu.be/QUR7B0HJpS4?si\=g\-OIncZ8Z0wRURE3](https://youtu.be/QUR7B0HJpS4?si=g-OIncZ8Z0wRURE3)

It's not new that CourseMediocre was hated(I can't say otherwise, there's some people that were very hostile), I was also of the group that was disagreeing with what she was doing in this sub and can't lie that I think that her whole contribution had a negative outcome on this sub, but no need to be an asshole nonetheless.

I'll be honest, I don't even know what to think of that whole situation, scams exist, people can fake a whole personality and it's hard to say if we really know the person we talk to, especially when it's in long distance. There are people who theoriese that she's a bot, or a false account for farms karming, we will never know.

But for fuck sake guys, even if you think this whole situation is cringe, "a Reddit mod falling in love with her Reddit mod girlfriend who maybe doesn't even exist", a man is grieving, please be a fucking human and don't be an asshole. Would you like having multiple people bullying you, insulting you, when you were in a very vulnerable moment?

Riobox, I'm talking to you personally, there's people who think this whole situation is fake, some things feel sketchy(And honestly I can't lie that the possibility exists in my head) you should take a break of Reddit and take time to do the point in your life, I'm wishing you good luck, life isn't always fun.

If anybody who reads this struggle with mental health, please have a talk with somebody you trust, ending your life isn't a solution and there're so many beautiful things in life that are worth(my dm are open if someone wants to vent, I already have been in your place \<3\)

And CourseMediocre, I'd like to trust that you're real and at this point I don't care if I've been fooled, I just hope you're resting in peace.

You know, seeing some comments in this post really made me realize how much Coursemediocre's overall positivity and funny posts was overshadowing a lot of shitty members in this community.

I know that going through all of this will be your own personal journey, but I hope that it ends somewhat okay, and that you're able to move on from this, best regards Riobox

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Missing from the previous commenter’s write up are three (edit: 4\) key facts: 

1\) in the book the MMC meets the FMC when she is actually a toddler and is her father’s best friend. The MMC apparently talks about the FMC sexually when he first meets her, as a toddler.

2\) The author is married to her father’s best friend who has known her since she was a toddler.

3\) The author has posted about her toddler and preschool daughters in gross, sexual ways.

4\) The author added content that she knew to be illegal in her country *after* her editor had finished with the book, which is why the editor was not found guilty. 

Edit: BBC article with more information: <https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzv529v5no>

Edit 2: this [r/RomanceBooks](/r/RomanceBooks) thread has more information from the time she was arrested. Trigger warnings for the discussion of CSAM in this thread. <https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/s/KvwJVm9LTL>

<https://imgur.com/2S20JNX> \- Here's the review of an ARC someone posted before GoodReads removed the book from the site

<https://imgur.com/vxuSXuq> \- Here's a post from the author's own social media where she literally has the male MC talking about how the female MC is "FINALLY 18," and how he's "wanted her longer than he can legally admit."

These make it pretty abundantly clear that this is not a normal DD/lg / age play / age gap romance book.

It is, quite literally, sexualizing and glorifying grooming and pedophilia.

I'm not advocating for her to go to prison. I am begging people to actually consider the whole scope of what is contained here and realize that we can stand against the criminalization of books while also not acting like what this woman wrote isn't exactly what it is:

Blatant child pornography in verbal form that this woman published and tried to sell, \*knowing\* it was illegal in her country (which begs the question of why) \-\- which is why she circumvented her editors and Beta Readers with the problematic material and added it in after the fact.

Even LitErotica doesn't let you publish works that sexualize minors, FFS.

Again, not saying she should go to prison, but we should not be normalizing writing / publishing shit like this.

As gross as this is, and I'm sure a thousand people are going to scream at me, how is this different than horror novels depicting disemboweling someone from the killer's perspective? Like, King got away with writing about child orgies. Am I missing something in this case? Is it illegal because it promotes this disgusting behavior happening in real life?

> * “America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death. Year 1969

really hope he’s just engagement baiting, but even so, it went stupidly far. bcs this whole thing is the fakest shit i’ve ever seen, all the interactions are kindergarten level theatre writing

“she” was inactive because he initially saw “her” profile was getting targeted due to bad posts, so he faked his porn focused alt account’s death both to save face of the humiliation he’s been facing all around the website and to make people feel guilty for criticising his alt account’s posts, because he clearly is quite insecure with criticism, as seen by the amount of comments and posts he removes

that guy and his obsession with ai characters (see his personal website) is on another level of unhealthy

this whole thing is the most ridiculous thing i’ve seen this year, for his own sake, hope he gets off the internet and into some irl hobbies. he’s still young and can redirect his life, spending his time doing this is genuinely ridiculous

he’s on german time, and he couldn’t even wait until the end of day to post the fake update because he couldn’t go to sleep with the idea that he was being humiliated left and right

he will prob keep the whole pretend game and permaban anyone who calls this, but seriously, i’m praying for that man

I don't want to be mean but the DMs from her brother seem suspect...I've seen this circus of faking your death online to get away from shit a few times before.

This is so stupidly fake. 

It screams like someone wanting to quietly take over the subreddit and their old persona was caught or whatever.

Reminded of an "anarchist" who really was a man pretending to be someone else so when they got caught that they really weren't an anarchist, and also weren't who they claimed to be, they faked their death...

Her brother didn’t seem too shook up by it all. If they were not close why would he casually going through their personal stuff so quickly? And sending “she’s no more more” to random people on Reddit??

Either the sub is in on the joke, or every single person in that comment section is functionally braindead. Like genuinely so fucking stupid, they shouldn't be allowed to reproduce, so terminally online they should be analyzed for science.

I would pay to go to a zoo if the people in that comment section were the animals.

After scrolling through the sub for a bit, I think it's the ladder.

The whole thing is suspect, first and foremost how he casually brings up how he was grieving due to the situation?

If I was in his position and I assume many others, we wouldn't bring up how we grieved in detail, we'd mention how it affected us (for example) "This situation has made me more isolated, emotional, and I've been grieving more than usual".

Second of all the DMS??? The first that many have mentioned is the brother checking reddit DMS (assuming he has the phone now for a few days), why would the brother check out the DMS? I would never do that to my siblings phones God forbid if a situation like that were to occur. It would however make sense if the brother had posted an update to her profile breaking the news.

Aka, "I'm u/.... Family member and unfortunately so and so user has passed away." This approach would make the most sense instead of invading her privacy and checking DMS.

Also, the way OP responded to the "brothers" DMS was very odd too, switching constantly from caplocks to then lowercase, also the caplocks reminds me of my teenage days when I would yell at my friends over text in a playful manner. This didn't make the responses from OP in my opinion seem genuine. 

I don't know, the whole thing seems very suspect, also the way he immediately replaced her with a mod too, if he was really grieving he'd be off the sub for a few days, weeks, or a month even, not just replace her with a mod straight away.

My theory \- 

The girl ghosted him and faked her own death. From what I saw, she was getting heat for power tripping as a mod. She wanted out. And if she cared about him, she would have given him her phone \#. OP is referring to her as his wife after a few months of dating, you're telling me he didn't scare her? Oh and also, maybe she saw what he looked like and wasn't into him. People vanish from the internet all the time, especially if it's just discord and reddit. People make new accounts.

But no, I don't think a brother is going into the phone of their sister who just died from suicide. I find it hard to believe he's going up to her face or using her finger to unlock her phone just to snoop, and then to DM someone.

Apparently, there's an archive of old comments from the mod where they are mostly speaking as an indian boy.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme2/comments/1r1orz0/rcoursemedicore7998_is_an_indian_boy_proof/>

One of these comments included their xbox username. That account was seen playing minecraft yesterday. Supposedly, the mod committed suicide 2 days ago.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme2/comments/1r1qids/playing_minecraft_from_the_grave/>

The boyfriend also claimed she was from Myanmar. Another one of these comments by the mod have them claiming to be from india.

I don't know man. It's fishy. No one talks about their dead family member like that. Maybe it's just me but even if my brother/sister isn't that close to me, at least I'd let the other person know how she passed with respect in my words. The "brother" said it like his pet lizard died.

Post Title:      yesterday a reddit mod made a missing post for his online gf who went offline for 2 days. and now it’s revealed that she allegedly killed herself, but people are suspicious that his gf was even real. i think charlie would find this ordeal intriguing

If the OP mod isn't in on it, my heart kind of hurts for him. It's so awful to feel. I wasn't catfished, but I had someone close to me fake his suicide and have all his friends tell me it was my fault etc. It's harrowing to lose someone you loved, regardless of if they were truthful of who they were.

I have had a weird number of people in my life fake suicide and suicide attempts, some multiple times, so as sad as it is to say, I'm always extremely skeptical of this sort of thing.

Every where you go, people think you are not telling the truth base don tone and body language, etc. I've read and heard the same patterns from thousands of people in autism support groups since year 2009. People think people are drunk or on drugs because of motor skill issues, speech patterns, etc. Mentally different people are treated like crap.

Not exactly. The government has banned paying for explicit sexual acts to be performed. You can still subscribe but you can't pay a performer to specifically do X. It's been given the same situation as prostitution.

Consumers are demonized, but not the manufacturers? I would have expected that from North Korea, not from Sweden. Besides, Sweden has much bigger problems; they should be glad that men are getting their sexual kicks online and not on the street.

You can still offer content as a creator (eg feedposts, mass messages), but custom content and chatting have been restricted. Also \- by „user“ they mean the consumer, not the creator.

i hate it, i hate that nearly 1/10 18\-24 girls have done in America......its evil. the way it corrupts young men and women. (most women make hardly any money, but the photos last forever)

but freedom is much better than a government telling me what's acceptable. 

trust me they wont stop there. soon it will be books they dont like, ban "anti\-government" sites. pron games, then FPS games. look at the uk for proof

Those lonely broken men so scared to talk to women will still exist 

is this real or bs?

> Like I've said on this GitHub a few times in the past 10 days... hot girls in my high school would talk to each other in my classroom in front of me. I was a book nerd at age 15 when I was my first year in high school. I would hang out in school just reading alone and I never gossiped or shared rumors. So girls would sit near me and talk to each other as if i was not a threat. I was reading /  studying computer books and other nonfiction. Hot girls in my large high school were not dating other high school boys... they were talking about adult men. I linked the song "Check It Out" John Mellencamp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxDBiiVjlQ This was in 1984, 1985, 1986 when I knew the age of these girls in my school classes. age 15, 16. to be a hot girl, you got the attention of powerful men when outside school at the mall or wherever these girls were meeting adult men.

> These 30 year old men who are manipulating and seducing ate 15 / age 16 girls was going on in front of me in my high school freshman and sophomore class when I knew the age of these girls. 1985, 1986. I really think people don't *listen* to what is going on around them. It isn't just "Epstein island". Powerful and manipulative men treat this as some kind of conquest and sport. The billionaire class in Bellevue, owner of sports empires... the social access that has...
> 
> There are some people who don't cover up their age 14 age 15 youth in the music industry and film industry.. I mean you are in front of adults and everyone is looking at you. An attractive / hot person draws influence and power brokers. People like Donald trump are in the Miss Universe in Moscow show. Sports team owners like Paul Allen / Jody Allen... I mean that's their social power over society. the Simpsons make a joke about it... Season 11, Episode 12, "Perks of the International Waters" - but private jets and private cruise ships that billionaires own allow... bypassing a lot of scrutiny.

Dumb move. Lonely losers from the US pay a bag for Swedish babes. This could’ve been a nice way to extract some capital from over the pond into the local market, and make some ladies rich from the safety of their home.

This is a very vague and misinformed statement. Regulated sex work should be viewed a respectable way to make money, because it’s one of the only markets where most sellers are women and most buyers are men. I feel governments are subconsciously terrified of the female demographic “taking” money from the male demographic in the industry. One’s nudes being online should not exclude them from societal acceptance or a well respected job.

The dude has autism, go easy on him. Autistic people are very vulnerable to catfishing. The "not normal behavior" is just autism.

> SUPER_HYPER_NORMAL "normal" behavior is people following Donald Trump images on /r/All every hour of every day since June 16, 2015. "normal" is hate-based leadership with hundreds of millions of followers. "normal" behavior is parents who have fed Fox News into their children at age 10 and feed Donald Trump as a role model of mature responsible successful leaders... without being alarmed, disturbed, calling for Dr. Bandy X Lee's assembly of 27 mental health professionals in a nonfiction book to be steady topic of everyone on the same page since October 3, 2017 publication. "normal" is the richest people in the entire world gaslighting poor and poorly educated rural with the most powerful media systems ever created by humanity.
> 
> QUOTE FROM NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:
> 
> Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.
> 
> Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”
> 
> Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”
> 
> That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

As others have said, some women get mad when they find out you're masturbating.

Side note, if your partner gets upset at you for masturbating, assuming you're not neglecting your partner or their needs, that should be a red flag. What you do with your body is your choice and doesnt affect them, to try and guilt you for it is manipulative. Too many guys I know think it's normal for their partner to be upset at them for performing natural sexual maintenance.

Are we watching the same video? He didn't confirm shit. He clearly says that this is not something he learned as President, meaning he's just saying he believes they are real.

I think it's crazy that this just keeps getting repeated everywhere on reddit because UFO nerds are just slobbering over any mention of aliens that they take everything as proof.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases.

I ran into someone like this at the grocery store the other day (also the US). Didn’t like that I parked next to him I guess? Ended up filming him after he threatened to smash all my windows in and shouted a bunch of homophobic slurs. Went on to call a woman who stepped in a whore and a c\-nt and then threaten to splatter my brains all over the parking lot before finally leaving. I said nothing this whole time. He just went ballistic on his own. 

People out here are entirely nuts these days. Doesn’t give me a lot of faith in humanity.

Can confirm. I know it will be a pain in my ass the rest of my career. 

Obviously it's annoying, but when my client was consulting ChatGPT to double check my work in front of me what was most concerning was the way it nurtured the relationship between the user and the AI. Before giving the answer, there would always be some kind of affirmation or praise for asking such a good question and for being responsible enough to research the answer before making a decision. Shit gave me the willys.

I'm a paramedic. We already get patients who call us after consulting Chatgpt for medical advice. So far none of them had a serious problem that justified an ambulance. 

In medicine all symptoms and medical data require correct interpretation. Context matters a lot. If you feed a chat bot with some generic symptoms, it will almost certainly go for the worst possible outcome and tell you you have a heart attack or cancer. An experienced medical professional will immediately see where the bot went wrong.

What they lack is comprehension and understanding. "Reading between the lines" and metaphor understanding are not the same as "literacy" and "reading". In the era of Donald Trump as a role model, so many claim that Trump can not read... when in fact, I have seen time and time again that Trump has an eye for media ecology in a way Marshall McLuhan teaches that the hate-watching fandom of Trump does not comprehend or understand. Clearly people are attracted to the unique style and unusual ways of Trump, but people can not recognize it as a mass man (Marshall McLuhan terminology) social cult behavior.

For FY2026, the forecasted capital expenditures of Amazon's $200 billion, Alphabet's $185 billion, Meta's $125 billion, Microsoft's $117\.5 billion, and Oracle's $50 billion is insane. When the AI hype train crashes, we are looking at 2000 Tech Bubble burst or worse a 1991 Japanese bubble burst. Likely, we are facing the prospects of Japan's Lost Decades.

Yea, all of these companies should NEVER have been allowed to even get anywhere near this big.

All of these huge tech companies have more buying power than the majority of nations in the world. They can make and break almost anyone.

The Doggy example a year ago with gov efficiency (lol) was actually just continuing the work that companies like amazon and FB have been doing for over a decade, forcing local governments to turn over mountains of sensitive information and then using it as further leverage to get massive sweetheart tax free deals. At the end of those deals, they will argue that they need the incentives still(too big to fail), and they won't pay any taxes then either.

If Amazon wanted to build one of these data centers for AWS, they'd go to local government, say we need to see all your books, and we would like to build our center here, and we need to see all the ways we can help you, and also just verify that this is a good location to us. Except they did that EVERYWHERE(but they sure as hell didn't build in all those places). They know how the government works better than the fucking government does in most places, it's obscene.

Allowing all these companies to obtain TRILLIONS in leverage, is a blunder that we're not going to come back from easily. The class war has been largely won and I expect it will probably stay that way for between 20\-100 years. At least if people decide that we only have access to solutions *within* the existing systems. Anyone paying attention knows that these goons have been using *outside* the system methods since always, but we're not even supposed to talk about it.

Post Title:      TIL Weird Al was set to a series of Star Wars parody sketches where he would interact with the movie via green-screening, but Mark Hamill refused to allow usage of any footage with him in it, despite already getting approval from Lucas and Alec Guinness, so the idea was scrapped

My concern of why computer industry didn't develop a variable-name file-name special-use characters for dash / underscore and space so that it could be rendered different in consoles and code editors and still maintain some sanity with command-line argument and parameter spaces. No special keyboard difference would be required, as it could have been built into filename prompts and context-intelligent editors could realize when a variable name is being used. Such as: "IF A_B_C = 10 GOTO LABEL_NAME" - where this underscore is unique. And, also the issue of special quotation marks for putting words into other people's mouths - non-literal quotes of what a person might say or in the style of a person.

People seriously need to stop calling internet ID requirements “age verification.” None of these people care about how old you are. Discord users had a major impact on the Nepal government, and now some powerful people are making sure that, if people start organizing somewhere else, they’ll have their names and addresses.

This headline is another example of the ongoing corporate sanewashing. Users aren't fleeing age\-verification, they're refusing an unnecessary incursion of their privacy from a service that just experienced a breach of exactly the kind of data they're demanding and is forking over that data willingly to Peter Thiel with everything that implies. But yet again the media apparatus is spinning it to the layman to seem as if it's just a bunch of kids stacked in trenchcoats upset that they're being kicked out of the X rated section of the video rental store and predators upset that they've lost their material. And the icing on the cake is that it's Kotaku doing it.

I just don't understand how this isn't and has not been transparently obvious to anyone paying attention, and that's disheartening to me.

NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Jen Senko hasn't been good enough for Reddit users to repeat and make a household name. Neil Postman wrote a book about the Fox News crisis in year 1985 which is 11 years before Fox News spun up in 1996. We have the same problem with the classic religion cults, people can not imagine that religions are **not supernatural** - which means potentially ANYONE can capture others with patterns of books and clergy and buildings. It is LITERALLY a storybook with a cult fandom who hates people who where raised by parents on DIFFERENT storybooks. We have, as a planet, no no way "Woken Up" to this crisis.

Anyone have a good recommendation for something similar? I use discord for friends, but I also use it as a tool for school as a community for people to post their work and discuss projects with me. It's nice to have channels and things to share images and thoughts with, along with voice chat when needed.

Idk what they were thinking taking the glasses there. Recording in a court room is generally not allowed. Some judges opt to immediately file contempt charges.

When you’re in court because your product was accused of exacerbating suicidal thoughts, what the fuck would possess you to bring a device that serves as an accessory to that same product? It’s like wearing the bloody gloves to court when you’ve been accused of murder.

And Trump is the opposite of autistic people. Trump golfs, Trump travels, Trump speaks in front of cameras and on stages constantly without fear.

It’s so petty how toxic fans are whining over a plot point that is important to the context. This is Gooseworx’s vision, you can’t just demand her to make things change. It’s her story and she’s going to keep it that way. Changing things from toxic demand can critically damage the plot. She didn’t deserve this

If you don't like a story, go write fanfiction. Or just don't watch. Leaving the community is definitely a wrong move here, being openly less tolerant of this kind of nonsense is what all reasonable tadc fans should do.

Well I'm sure Im not the only one who has warned everyone, let Gooseworx and the cast be. everyone gets too focused on this that Gooseworx may just stop , you're harassing the creator of the thing you love most and for what? you have no power at the end of the day just all the harassment claims. 
Honestly I wouldn't blame her for shutting down this whole show if a portion of the fans keep giving her shit like this. It'd suck sure but it would also prove that Gooseworx is still in control

guy named Chase Car got banned by Youtube's AI moderation for nothing, so he sued Youtube under EU regulations, and won, but Youtube still refuses to restore his channel

> OBSERVE: people do not call for Reddit to solve the "bots" issue. Instead, people turn on each other. This is the general attitude towards billionaires and what they create. Complain, but do not organize. THIS_GITHUB project is about showing example after example of common serious society problems created by "Conservative International 2013" mass dehumanization movement that people do not blame for the enshitification of society. Tragedy of the commons, the common mindsets are pummeled by billionaire systems.

Going to say the same thing I always do when people bring up JRR Tolkien and allegory: Tolkien was an English professor with an exacting vocabulary. By the strict definition of the word, a work is only allegory if it directly correlates one\-to\-one with something in the real world. Animal Farm is probably the easiest example of allegory. You can easily read the book and pick out Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and all the other major players in the Bolshevik revolution as it turned to Stalinism.

Tolkien vastly preferred applicability, where the reader could connect the text to elements in their own life. Lord of the Rings is not allegory as it is properly defined, but it is highly applicable to a number of things.

> In Twitter think society year 2025, the most upvoted popular comment is a question. A science question that could be answers with a search engine like Google Search... but instead, the Trumpism society loves "engaging" audiences with low-effort commenting. That's what is popular and voted to the top of the page. In 1995, this was described as "lowest common denominator" 3.5 second media content.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

> PRE_COMPUTED_THINKING_EXERCISED_THINKING There have been periods in my life where I read serious nonfiction almost every day at age 18, 19, 20, 21 and I would think about many variations of any idea over hours and hours. Pre-computing thinking is what she is describing as "being inside her head" a lot. I also starting in Thanksgiving 1999 when I moved full time into my first RV, a VW Westy 1967 Camper and went from Renton to Lake Havasu City to live that winter before my March 25 wedding... I would analyze and study restaurants and specific dishes described on travel forums and visitor writings and then got to the place in person a few times and compare what people wrote and described vs. my own experience and the variations in times of day, how busy the place ways, weekday vs. weekend, etc. Comparative experiences. I've done this for hundreds of cities.
