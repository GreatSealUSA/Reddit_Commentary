Post Title:      Discord Rival Gets Overwhelmed By Mass Exodus Of Players Fleeing Age-Verification Crackdown  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
This headline is another example of the ongoing corporate sanewashing. Users aren't fleeing age\-verification, they're refusing an unnecessary incursion of their privacy from a service that just experienced a breach of exactly the kind of data they're demanding and is forking over that data willingly to Peter Thiel with everything that implies. But yet again the media apparatus is spinning it to the layman to seem as if it's just a bunch of kids stacked in trenchcoats upset that they're being kicked out of the X rated section of the video rental store and predators upset that they've lost their material. And the icing on the cake is that it's Kotaku doing it.

I just don't understand how this isn't and has not been transparently obvious to anyone paying attention, and that's disheartening to me.

NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Jen Senko hasn't been good enough for Reddit users to repeat and make a household name. Neil Postman wrote a book about the Fox News crisis in year 1985 which is 11 years before Fox News spun up in 1996. We have the same problem with the classic religion cults, people can not imagine that religions are **not supernatural** - which means potentially ANYONE can capture others with patterns of books and clergy and buildings. It is LITERALLY a storybook with a cult fandom who hates people who where raised by parents on DIFFERENT storybooks. We have, as a planet, no no way "Woken Up" to this crisis.

Anyone have a good recommendation for something similar? I use discord for friends, but I also use it as a tool for school as a community for people to post their work and discuss projects with me. It's nice to have channels and things to share images and thoughts with, along with voice chat when needed.

Post Title:      Judge warns smart glasses wearers of contempt charges as Zuckerberg testifies in Meta trial  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  

> In August 2025, a TikTok user described visiting a European Wax Center in Manhattan and discovering that her aesthetician was wearing Meta Ray\-Bans. The worker claimed she hadn't charged the batteries, but the incident still left the TikToker shaken. The company later said employees keep the glasses turned off during appointments.

Wtf?

Idk what they were thinking taking the glasses there. Recording in a court room is generally not allowed. Some judges opt to immediately file contempt charges.

When you’re in court because your product was accused of exacerbating suicidal thoughts, what the fuck would possess you to bring a device that serves as an accessory to that same product? It’s like wearing the bloody gloves to court when you’ve been accused of murder.

And Trump is the opposite of autistic people. Trump golfs, Trump travels, Trump speaks in front of cameras and on stages constantly without fear. And Trump puts RFK Jr in charge of communicating to the nation on causes of autism. Which no autistic person would ever desire RFK Jr's ideas and advice.

It’s so petty how toxic fans are whining over a plot point that is important to the context. This is Gooseworx’s vision, you can’t just demand her to make things change. It’s her story and she’s going to keep it that way. Changing things from toxic demand can critically damage the plot. She didn’t deserve this

Well I'm sure Im not the only one who has warned everyone, let Gooseworx and the cast be. everyone gets too focused on this that Gooseworx may just stop , you're harassing the creator of the thing you love most and for what? you have no power at the end of the day just all the harassment claims. 
Honestly I wouldn't blame her for shutting down this whole show if a portion of the fans keep giving her shit like this. It'd suck sure but it would also prove that Gooseworx is still in control

Going to say the same thing I always do when people bring up JRR Tolkien and allegory: Tolkien was an English professor with an exacting vocabulary. By the strict definition of the word, a work is only allegory if it directly correlates one\-to\-one with something in the real world. Animal Farm is probably the easiest example of allegory. You can easily read the book and pick out Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and all the other major players in the Bolshevik revolution as it turned to Stalinism.

Tolkien vastly preferred applicability, where the reader could connect the text to elements in their own life. Lord of the Rings is not allegory as it is properly defined, but it is highly applicable to a number of things.

> In Twitter think society year 2025, the most upvoted popular comment is a question. A science question that could be answers with a search engine like Google Search... but instead, the Trumpism society loves "engaging" audiences with low-effort commenting. That's what is popular and voted to the top of the page. In 1995, this was described as "lowest common denominator" 3.5 second media content.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Pre-computing thinking is what she is describing as "being inside her head" a lot. I also starting in Thanksgiving 1999 when I moved full time into my first RV, a VW Westy 1967 Camper and went from Renton to Lake Havasu City to live that winter before my March 25 wedding... I would analyze and study restaurants and specific dishes described on travel forums and visitor writings and then got to the place in person a few times and compare what people wrote and described vs. my own experience and the variations in times of day, how busy the place ways, weekday vs. weekend, etc. Comparative experiences. I've done this for hundreds of cities.
