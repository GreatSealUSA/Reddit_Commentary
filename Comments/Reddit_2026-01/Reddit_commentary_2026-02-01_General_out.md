Literally no one’s cares Jaknob. I’ve seen so many men with pretty much a like for like bio/full thesis on why women with kids are the “absolute drain of society” etc. It’s hard for them to think outside of that hate filled box so all spew the same, it’s actually giving mommy issues

As someone who once ODed on Benadryl, i was constantly taking to this guy who was walking right with me. Having full on conversations just for me to turn around and for him to vanish. 
I didn't see a hat man but there was always a familiar presence with whom I was talking to who periodically vanishes when I turn around.

Someone is hand filling a 20 gauge shotgun shell with Benadryl.

The joke here is, he is going to shoot an overdose of Benadryl at home invaders, so that they’re both wounded, and overdose a delirium shadow demon that people refer to seeing when they overdose.

Ok. So this is a play on the home\-intruder defence / Home Alone antics that often involves setting up shotgun shells to fire at intruders.

Home\-made shrapnel solutions such as nails and rock salt are common constituents for such improvised explosive devices.

In this case OP is dosing theirs with Benadryl. Overdosing on this can have weird and unpleasant side effects such as hallucinations and disappearing to a pocket dimension.

Notice around that time the Andrew scandal was starting to leak out, the Meghan hate campaign was brutal in the British press? Harry said his wife became sucidal and knew that they were being used as scape goats and he had no option but to leave to save his family.

Whenever you see Harry and Meghan hate know that the Andrew and Fergie's team are behind it.

Britain is just as Racist as America, the Brits just are good at pretending but not anymore as Reform continues to gain momentum.

You guys are unhinged. 

He was invited (amongst other prominent people) to a premier. Probably happened hundreds of times from hundreds of publicity teams. 

There's zero evidence that Rowling associated with him. 

You can do better.

Oof! I commented in that thread, but I guess I was too early to witness the shitstorm that followed. I was pretty impressed with the photo, myself. It's an angle of aviation that we rarely get to see, aside from when a plane appears a Google Maps tile, which often are too blurry. A real picture is a hundred times better

I’m a pilot with the RCAF’s Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team. I tried to post some cool pictures of our off\-season training a few weeks ago. Those were taken in\-flight with a vintage analog camera. They were immediately taken down for no reason… I haven’t bothered trying to post anything since, to be honest.

His point about Arc Raiders not being an e\-sports or competitive title is 100% accurate. There are certain games that are designed to be "sweaty" and cater to ranked play, etc. Arc Raiders is not one of them. It's an entirely casual game. The only way to make this game competitive would be to remove all the RNG aspects of it, which would essentially transform the game into something else entirely.

Let this game be what it is: casual fun. The game already has AGMM to let you get into "sweaty" PvP lobbies if you so choose.

The people asking for this to become an actual competitive game are missing the point of an extraction shooter with massive RNG elements to it.

No, don’t ban a medicine saving the lives of morbidly obese people. It’s not the faults of the people who use it correctly under the supervision of a reputable a doctor. Unless the doctor is being bribed no reputable doctor would give it to a non diabetic with a healthy BMI. To ban things because celebs with eating disorders are getting thinner is insane. Don’t punish the millions of people who are obese and finally being able to lose weight for vain rich girls who cheat the system.

The claim sounds damning, like a muckraking headline or clickbait. It makes her sound like maybe she's not smart, but no one can explain Trinity.

It's a joke because you can define the trinity, but there's almost no way to explain the Holy Trinity without committing heresy. That's why they describe it as a Divine mystery.

Furthermore we wouldn't expect a Pop Star like Sabrina Carpenter to have the answer, making the accusation itself is even more absurd.

Its actually kind of funny.

I just paid $4300 for my daughter to have a 5 minute endoscopy, on top of another $1700 that I had to pay last year when she had an emergency. Completely emptied out any health savings account money we had. Without insurance these would have cost me over $40,000\. MURICA

The important takeaway of this video isn't how that China is amazing. 

This kind of experience, to a somewhat lesser degree, is basically universal all over the globe. It might not take 19minutes and cost 12usd, but perhaps 60minutes and cost 25usd.

The important takeaway is how China and THE WHOLE WORLD differs from the madness that is the US health care system!

My father in law is Chinese and is currently having cancer treatment in China. This video is VERY misleading with its implications. You’ll notice how she was asked if she wanted “Normal” or “Expert” care. That’s a REALLY important distinction. China’s medical system is cheap and quick, so it’s fine for minor illnesses. Anything significant though and you’re screwed unless you are very rich or happen to personally know the doctor treating you at the hospital. My father in law is poor but luckily his doctor is a childhood friend of his, so he gets disproportionately adequate care despite being poor. Nursing in China is considered a bad job; for people who aren’t smart enough to go to a good school, so the quality of nurses is very bad. Bribes are important for proper care, just like in China’s education system. Don’t bribe your doctor enough and you’re taking a major risk that they won’t prioritize you. My wife has spent a lot of money on “gifts” to send back to China for my mother in law to give to the staff treating my FIL. Hospitals don’t provide food for patients, so my MIL has to spend two hours a day riding the bus back and forth to bring him food. My wife went to visit him recently and pretty much everyday someone at their small hospital was told that they wouldn’t receive lifesaving medical care because they were too poor to afford it. All around very depressing stuff. There’s a reason China’s ultra wealthy seek medical care overseas if they are able to do so.

TLDR: China is alright for minor illnesses, but unless you’re extremely rich or lucky, for anything serious it is not a good medical system

So, in your first paragraph, do you mean that your wife has worn white to someone else's wedding BEFORE this time? Man, you need to rethink who you're married to. And she's this mad over you not being in the wedding party? I hope you don't have kids. You need to do a Homer\-Simpson\-back\-into\-the\-hedge meme out of your marriage.
