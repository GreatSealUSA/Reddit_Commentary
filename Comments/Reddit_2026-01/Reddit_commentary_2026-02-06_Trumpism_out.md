> Every day I encounter minds that behave like this Reddit comment. Trump is a source of "locker room talk", Trump's ability to amuse and create laughs for fandoms far exceeds anyone's desire to travel the world, raise children, do anything but chuckle all day an night on their smartphone about how dumb idiot stupid we all are now. Superbowl billionaire celebration is coming up. I helped purchase the Seahawks for Jody Allen. I interviewed the coach and players briefly one on one in their office and on the practice field. The Experience Music Project, Experience Sports Owner Project, Experience ESPN Hosting Project... I had any research and learning tool I could ever need.

> Eternal September late 1993 and early 1994 never ended. I had a background in social media with The Fortress in 219 area code an from-scratch Commodore 128 app I had developed and sold commercially. I was a believer in open Usenet like I was a believer in open SMTP e-mail. But, I have to admit, nobody ever noticed, including me. That Microsoft Exchange Server used used SMTP for e-mail but did not use NNTP for Public Folders. The "social media" was proprietary and had no convention to share with outside world. The e-mail did, but not the social media.

> The progress of Internet speed and CPU speed alone and mobile networks was what I focused on instead. Travel and working from home office since Thanksgiving 1999. But I came home from living in South America the day after Katrina hit South Florida "South Florida Landfall: Katrina made its first U.S. landfall on August 25, 2005, at approximately 6:30 p.m. EDT". I still remember, because we had a new RV waiting for housing and we could not get car insurance, they banned sales of car insurance in Florida. So we couldn't move into our pre-arranged housing after flying in to Miami. My mom and dad were retired and living in The Villages, but my wife and I both worked from home and had the TV all planned out. It ended up being just a 1 day delay as we managed to get insurance out of Texas address and take delivery of the new RV off the dealer lot.

Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), released on April 23, 2009 for SXSW 2009. Had some fun parties, but Linux on the smarpthone with Android / Google was the hot thing... not Linux on the desktop in 2009.

The Great Seal USA pyramid was now the center of attention to women in north Africa. Women were using USA Twitter, USA Facebook, USA YouTube.

"Vote harder" as all the avoidance of nonfiction, avoidance of Jen Senko leadership, avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee is "upvote" every minute of every hour of every day and night, over and over on Reddit.

> 
> CAMPBELL: Well, people do experience it. Those in the Middle Ages who experienced it were usually burned as heretics. One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, “I and the Father are one.” He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, [a great Sufi mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hallaj) said, “I and my beloved are one,” and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, “O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works.” Another of the **Sufi mystics** said, “The function of the orthodox community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death.”

> 
> MOYERS: Always wrong?

The Twitter June 6, 2011 really did a number on Reddit hearts and minds and rural less-educated peoples. Media addicts, meme addictions, run wild on Reddit and you can trace back to the meme-thinking origins of images bandwidth vs. text-base social. Reddit didn't used to host video and images. Old Reddit vs. New Reddit. ***Everything Is Media Ecology***. The Internet Research Agency since March 2013 won hearts and minds. So many IRA copycats now.

There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, **have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality**. Those who have written vigorously on the matter tell us, for example, that what is happening is the residue of an exhausted capitalism; or, on the contrary, that it is the tasteless fruit of the maturing of capitalism; or that it is the neurotic aftermath of the Age of Freud; or the retribution of our allowing God to perish; or that it all comes from the old stand-bys, greed and ambition. **I have attended carefully to these explanations**, and I do not say there is nothing to learn from them. Marxists, Freudians, Lévi-Straussians, even Creation Scientists are not to be taken lightly. And, in any case, I should be very surprised if the story I have to tell is anywhere near the whole truth." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

The postmodern is a blurring of the lines between human beings and machines, a blurring of the line between reality and image. It is a society – actually I can’t even really use that word anymore – it is a world, if you will, a grouping of the world in which **reality is simply that which can be simulated, Xeroxed, copied**. That is one of his first theses, it’s a book called Simulations. It’s a very interesting thesis. Baudrillard argues that this process is… one of the central things is the way in which **we… that’s changed us fundamentally and has helped to bring our relations as humans to a close**. I mean, in a way Baudrillard sees himself as a post-apocalyptic writer. For Baudrillard the apocalypse has already occurred; it wasn’t religious or anything, it was not atomic bombs. At some point in the development of technology, **human beings ceased to be the reason** of things and things took on their own reasons… technological things." - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/ - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University

she's right and she's right to say it! 

i agree that everyone involved needs to be removed from office. no matter what their political alignment is. i hate when conservatives think they have a gotcha by going "heh, if you want to take down everyone in the Epstein files, what about BILL CLINTON??? checkmate libs"

first of all idgaf about Bill Clinton. and even if it was a politician i liked, i would no longer like them if they were involved in this shit!

He needs to be impeached (charged by the house) then removed (convicted by the senate). Then imprisoned for his crimes. His MAGA followers are so racist and hateful, they're okay with the president being a pedophile as long as they can get brown and black people out of the US.

Our country is in a deep state of corrosion. The very fabric of our society is rotten from lack of accountability from our institutions. That goes for *all* political parties, the Epstein files have only proven what we all knew.

Nixon should have gone to prison, setting a precedent for future presidents, but no. In the interest of “moving on” our leaders never pay for their crimes while their victims continue to suffer.

Genuine question because this drove me crazy the other day: “picture” with her and kid rock has been removed from her albums on streaming (Spotify and Apple Music) and I had to go find my actual physical copy of her greatest hits to make sure I wasn’t going crazy. It’s gone?

I figured she pulled it because she was like “I’m not giving this pos royalty money” and this kind of doubles down on that but I found it so interesting.

> 
> * "Based on available information, Sheryl Crow has not publicly condemned Eric Clapton regarding his past racist remarks or controversial views on COVID-19 vaccinations. Following their brief romantic relationship in the late 1990s, the two have remained on good terms, with Crow frequently expressing admiration for him, calling him a "good friend," and performing at his Crossroads Guitar Festival as recently as 2023. Despite the public controversy surrounding Clapton, Crow has not used her public platform to denounce him, instead collaborating with him as recently as her 2019 album Threads." - Google Search Summary, 2026-02-06 USA afternoon
> 
> * "Eric Clapton's history of controversial public statements is anchored by his infamous August 1976 concert at the Birmingham Odeon, where an inebriated Clapton launched into a racist tirade supporting far-right politician Enoch Powell. During the outburst, he repeatedly used slurs, urged the audience to “keep Britain white,” and claimed the country was becoming a "black colony". This event served as a primary catalyst for the founding of the Rock Against Racism movement. While his early 1960s career was defined by his obsession with Black American blues, critics have retrospectively examined this as a "colonialist" appropriation in light of his later rhetoric. Decades later, Clapton faced renewed backlash for his anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine positions during the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing songs like “Stand and Deliver” and “This Has Gotta Stop,” and suggesting that those following medical guidance were victims of "mass formation hypnosis". In later years, he admitted to being “a nasty person” and “full-tilt racist” during the 1970s, as well as confessing to domestic abuse against his former wife Pattie Boyd during that same era." - Google Search summary 2026-02-06 USA afternoon

That is a poll tax. Unless the documents required can be obtained for free (they aren’t), then this is already unconstitutional. It is a poll tax with extra steps.

It also doesn’t make sense to prove it while registering and while voting.

I introduced PARTS on OS/2 and flew to Glendale California for training conferences. https://www.OS2world.com/wiki/index.php/Part_3:_Digitalk%27s_PARTS:_Parts_Assembly_and_Reuse_Tool_Set. At SAP I was was working with every variation of Unix and hardware vendor client/server for R/3 - all before Microsoft staff had TCP/IP experience.

I came from Military Ada training on VAX/VMS, SAP R/3 on dozens of Unix platforms, from IBM AS/400. Even back in Fort Wayne, before SAP, I worked with RS/6000 server operations at Eagle Pitcher as a night operator and could do what I wanted with Unix. My university Purdue Fort Wayne, was a DEC VAX/VMS shop as was my high school, Snider High. As was my high school job at Telos, I had the free Microvax II system 1985 http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/uvax.html all night and weekends with 24 hour office access, my own office keys and root / sysadmin. It was a classroom system, all the Telos staff worked on-site at Magnavox https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/11/Magnavox-guilty-of-defense-contract-spying/2019655617600/ so the training system was idle at night and weekends for me to study and any books I wanted to order, Telos paid for. I would sit there reading military industry tech magazines for minimum wage at night and weekends, take operating system books and trade journals home and read at high school.

And 18 months leading the Microsoft servers call center in Garland Texas for Software Spectrum before I relocated to the Bellevue office of Egghead consulting https://www.Spokesman.com/stories/1996/apr/14/egghead-deal-paves-way-for-software-spectrum acquired by Software Spectrum consulting as the highest-level consultant working as a peer to Microsoft consulting. The existing Bellevue office staff were Lotus Notes IBM software guys, I got along great, we used Lotus Notes at SAP. I was an OS/2 published author.

> Thanksgiving 1996 I was settled in and we got a call from the big boys at MCS specifically requesting me to go visit Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft's, office. Bill Gates could have sent any number of Microsoft employees over to the founder's office... but they sent me because I had worked on an independent Exchange Server book and had taught staff at Microsoft for call center support (2 week course, 8 hour days, server at every desk, typically 15 to 20 students, solo teaching) in Redmond in February 1996 (my virgin trip to PNW, in final testing months, before June 11, 1996 release of Exchange Server) and had good teacher ratings by my Microsoft employee students.
> 
> I was sent to Atlanta during the Olympics teaching Georgia Pacific staff. It was the same two week course we used for support staff at Software Spectrum (and Microsoft employees in Redmond I had taught). I was there in Atlanta intermediate weekend Saturday, July 27, 1996 when the bomb went off, and my girlfriend (future wife) Tristan was freaked out calling me. Still remember those calls. Tristan and I relocated from Garland and Anna Texas to Kirkland Washington after my 18 months Garland call center agreement was over. August 1996 IIRC.
> 
> It was November 20 or so... a week or so before Thanksgiving 1996 and Paul Allen was still stuck on a pre-release version of Exchange Server since the June 11, 1996 release date. Nobody in Microsoft wanted to develop a pre-release to final release upgrade procedure. They telephoned my office and asked for consultation. I visited their office, reviewed their servers...  I said I could do it in the time Paul Allen was flying across the Atlantic ocean on Thanksgiving day when he didn't have TCP/IP or private connectivity on his private jets mid-ocean in 1996 yet. We upgraded that in 1997.... Vegas trade show trip to find the latest airline products.

Hmm. Amazing. Nothing about this excuse makes it better. The president exerts power through the people he appoints to government agencies. Should we trust his ability to appoint heads of agencies if he can’t appoint people capable of managing a social media feed? 

“The president isn’t racist. He just surrounds himself with racists and puts them into positions of power”… well that also sounds like something a racist would do, doesn’t it?

This is incredible on two parts. 

It shows how much anyone can just “impersonate” the fucking president, something that use to be literally impossible. But we know trump himself posted it testing the waters and when he didn’t get the big cheer he blames it on another. 

Secondly imagine any other job if you grabbed your bosses account on social media and posted this. Fired within seconds to hours right? At this nazi house you get rewarded.

Post Title:      Trump Frantically Blames ‘Staffer’ for His Racist Obama Video  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
It honestly perplexes me how this demented asshat is able to avoid responsibility for EVERYTHING he does. Every crime he's committed, every time he's raped children, every gaffe he's made, every wild declaration he's made, every time he has defied the Constitution, every time he has openly demonstrated how much a of a sick, demented and narcissistic fascist he is...he NEVER gets held accountable for it. He is never properly called out for it. And the worst thing is that one\-third of America is actively willing to help him avoid taking even an iota of responsibility for his actions.

It's genuinely depressing and disgusting to think about sometimes.

The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly **mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable**. ...

“How is it possible?”

Rhetorical question, I know, but, 32% of America’s free\-willed grown\-ass adults who outright voted for this, and another 37% of America’s free\-willed grown\-ass adults who couldn’t be bothered to vote at all to prevent it.

It’s not like this is the first time he’s been blatantly racist. He was peddling birtherism *fifteen freaking years ago* and he’s gotten an increasing number of votes and an increased share of the popular vote each time he’s been on the ballot in the decade since.

We have a societal problem, and it will not be going away with Donald Trump.

Trump allowed the degenerate Americans who used to hide in the dark alley to become mainstream. They were always there, but he’s given them a voice. 

This is who America is now and it will take a generation to rid itself of this stain.

No, bands just don't want their names attached to your fascist bullshit. That's called consequences and not cancel culture. Maybe try not being terrible people next time.

Yes and no. There are certainly a lot of conservative desert dwellers who live there full time, but there are also a considerable number of more left leaning folks who own second homes there, artists, woo woo hippies, local and international tourists due to Joshua Tree National Park. The park itself attracts more than 3 million visitors per year, while the town of Yucca Valley only has around 22,000 full time residents. Hence, you tend to see a lot of culture clash stuff like this sign, or a truck decked out in MAGA stickers parked next to a Prius with a pride flag and a dreamcatcher hanging from the rear view. 

There’s literally a vegan bakery across the street from the gun store.

Its insane how many of the current regime will be disbarred after this is over. Blondi would have been as shes been before the FL bar three times but they keep refusing to do it because they dont want to set a precedent of disbarring a sitting AG. 

Then we have the DoJ entering fraudulent evidence in 35\+ separate cases that judges remarked on in just the first 9 months besides all the malicious prosecution and other bs they keep doing for Trumps revenge tour that will have so many of them unable to practice law ever again.

Post Title:      Trump faces backlash over racist video portraying the Obamas as apes  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I don't think we've ever had a president with such poor decorum. When he's not insulting everyone who isn't bending the knee, he's literally shitting his diapers on TV. I honestly don't understand how someone can listen to Trump and think "yeah, this guy should control our nukes" when he can't even legally own a gun because he's a convicted felon.

Trump was an old white guy that got on Twitter July 6, 2011. https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 That's what changed. Reddit is what changed. Twitter is what hanged. The abandonment of Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan understandings of high-speed information systems is what changed.

No shit big tech companies including but not limited to google, apple, meta, amazon, microsoft, HP, micron, palantir and hundreds of other tech companies, private entities, funds and foundations have donated to dementia dons campaign, inauguration, ballroom and memecoin. These tech companies are either using the Trump admins grift to enrich themselves at the taxpayers expense or they are scared of the rise of socialism within the democratic party.

So since trump says he running again does that mean Obama can run again? If so pls pls pls sir help this country out!


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> To understand why Trump has so much power, this is part of the reason. Cult behavior so that only Obama can rescue. Kamala Harris or thousands of other qualified leaders can't do the job, only icons people already are locked into. The whole point of a Vice President replacing a President and such is that the job is a job. But people have used "the media", media systems, to become cult members and team-sports "winner takes all" logic. Millions of people can work at restaurants and run them successfully all over the USA. But people can't imagine 2000 or 3000 people qualified to be a good governor of California or leader of USA. We are a nation of 0.34 billion out of a planet o 8 billion people. Yet, our thinking is narrow and small-minded ideas.

I managed owner social networks to the NBA Portland Trailblazers, I managed the new owner integration with NFL Seattle Seahawks and met personally in the offices of Coach Mike Hologram and his IT staff. I was on call 24 hours a day as the in-house media systems / information systems expert for all the holdings for 2.5 years. These were no ordinary years. 1997 / 1998 / 1999 when Bill Gates and Paul Allen were DOUBLING WEALTH in a SINGLE YEAR! They could have hired any number of Microsoft employees or ex-employees to have Edward Snowden level access to Paul Allen's private messages and travel records of message access. But they hired me at age 27.

I was not a Microsoft insider and had never worked for any employee in the PNW. I was under employment of Garland Texas (DFW area). All my published books were as third-party, from major industry-independent book companies, not from insider Microsoft knowledge.

Just imagine the ridicule of having a Microsoft co-founder sports team owner e-mails leaked because of how shitty and poorly designed Exchange Server network security was and how inexperienced Microsoft was at enterprise security! Competitors to Microsoft Redmond at Novell Utah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell and big iron producers and Unix Sun and OpenBSD / Linux would have LOVED to see the Trailblazers, Seahawks, Paul Allen have a private message leak / breach about purchasing the team and hiring players!

I did not have a single friend or known co-worker  in Seattle, I was a TOTAL outsider, only my girlfriend from Texas who moved with me. Who I was supporting, she was unemployed her first year in Kirkland. She had lost her house in a fire in Texas which broke her relationship with her step-mother and was starting her life over.

It always has been. Read about the robber barons of the 19th century. The "deflowering" of young women was practically a sport amongst them. The vast majority of them are raised with privilege, and they have no concept of accountability. For the rest, well, being a complete sociopath can be a huge advantage in your climb to the top.

I missed the first hour of the opening ceremonies so I missed the booing, when I went to watch the replay on Peacock \- the entire section of time is muted aside from the music playing in the background. No boos, no commentators discussing the boos, no sounds but the faint background music.

Just today, i remarked this in another post. The majority of the responses were "all the world is the same".

The (voluntary?) blindness of some people is discouraging. Nothing will improve if they think that their politics, government and judicial silence is the normal, average reaction to a massive pedophilic ring.

Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

By that logic, only politicians can talk politics. All the rest of us can only talk about our jobs.

There's a difference between talking politics with your friends in a back and forth conversation where everyone has input or theres this which is just lecturing people and then running off camera.

Interesting story. Basically the whistleblower complaint was last year and Gabbard didn’t follow protocol for passing the information on. The White House says she did nothing wrong and was cleared of wrongdoing by the office of Inspector General. Who in the office cleared her? None other than Dennis Kirk, co\-founder of Project 25\. The rot goes deep.

I believe waiting for midterms is a huge mistake. We need to stop working now. They are building concentration camps, trying to pass the save act, and whatever Tulsi is doing with those voting machines …. We don’t have the luxury of waiting until November blindly believing that somehow we will have a fair vote.

I'm going to chime in because I also got an email from them with basically the same "demands". Yes these people are real. The organizer that I know told me that for 2028 they are already launching their efforts against Newsom because he hasn't been pro Palestinian enough and the one lady in Maine who claims to ge a democratic is actively trying to discredit both of Susan collins challengers ( love your profile header Pic BTW lol) including Graham platner because he ...and I quote "hasn't called for Israel to be dismantled". They've also now said mamdani and aoc are zionists.

*Ought* to be big. The Clinton Email story was actually pretty damning. If a whistleblower exposed that Clinton was concealing complaints against her to protect Obama's connections to foreign intelligence, it would have ended her career. But the age of accountability is over. The rules exist as a baton to protect the ruling class and crush dissent and opposition, this administration is beholden to no one and will destroy any defectors.

Since Trump has become President the first time, foreign adversaries have magically "discovered" military and commercial secrets that used to put America 10 years ahead of everyone else.

People's continued faith in the systems that are supposed to hold those in power accountable is going to be our downfall. If you're the whistleblower, this is the kind of shit you have to know is going to be buried. Giving the evidence to the very people you're trying to hold accountable never goes well, like this seems basic. We might have a chance if people abandon the already corrupted systems and just start posting shit. Let the chips fall where they may, but at least give the information a chance to reach the right people.

> No matter what Trump and Putin do, the important thing to USA Internet users, the entire society, is superficial and banal call-out about syntax. people don't read stories, they react to Tweets. This is why Trump wins. 500 short tiny antics works on minds that don't want a clear progressive working together with diverse language and arrangements. High-speed wrecks when even the slightest out of alignment is encountered. So fast in intake it blows out minds. Speedeating politics. Surkov students can blow minds, micro-blowing of minds with the most trivial patterns of communications.

There isn’t anything I say on Reddit that I wouldn’t say in person. People do not need to be afraid of exercising their rights. This is how we assert them in the face of fascism; not with meekness, but with loud, outspoken truth.

We know what makes this country great; it’s keeping people who forget that in check.

People need to learn to re\-associate that word. 

The Tuskegee experiments **were** a conspiracy. 

JFK being assassinated **was** a conspiracy. 

MKUltra **was** a conspiracy. 

Watergate **was** a conspiracy. 

Iran\-Contra **was** a conspiracy. 

The CIA running drugs for the cartels **was** a conspiracy. 

Illegal mass surveillance of USA citizens **was** a conspiracy. 

The Panama papers **were** a conspiracy.

The powers that be and the ultra wealthy **ARE** conspiring against everyone the deem below them. 

Calling people a conspiracy theorist has become associated with labeling them crazy and allowing everyone to dismiss them. 

People need to **wake the fuck up**.

Kidnapping Guthrie’s mom will definitely somehow change some of those 6 year old interviews, or at the very least make Guthrie want to quit journalism (which I guess would somehow invalidate her past work…?).

Wait, does any of that make sense?

Conspiracy Theories make the truly arrested development ignorant people feel smart.

Sometimes a turd is just a turd, nothing more. Coming up with these "theories" is just a way for way too many people with limited cognitive skills a way for it to make sense, instead if accepting the fact that bad things happen to good people many times.

I speculated with my own brainrot that because Savannah had been a vocal opponent to trump during the 2020 election cycle that this was enough since he's on his 2020 vengeance kick to have had state agents kidnap her mother to sew fear and intimidate a strong woman in corporate media who excoriated him during the town hall and one of his only public appearances on CNN. 

This is another "well that's odd" tidbits. Sure, it's possible, but is it likely? If it hadn't just lived through the last year, I'd have dismissed it as internet brain rot. Now, I'm not so sure.

Wow. And think about the ideology of the current US administration. It mirrors Russia's perfectly, wanting corrupt oligarchs and the state to be one and the same. This is really bad.

Think it's funny how Americans try to judge Europe for buying their gas and oil from Russia as if we have that many options on who to rely on, and now we switched and rely on the US for a lot of imports, and turns out they are just as bad as Russia and we just switched from a lunatic to another lunatic, who also happens to be a pedophile amongst other things.

I believe this was intentional; they looked like they were helping while planting the seed.

Nobody is going to censor a popular scene in a science fiction story like Star Wars Andor year 2025 or Quran science fiction story from year 635. People can keep discussing a Star Wars scene or a page of Mohammad's Quran fiction. This loophole is actively being utilized. Fox News HDTV can claim it is { amusement, entertainment, comedy, SNL Weekend Update, fantasy mythos }.

Kind of person that thinks the sun rises and set just for the US, and does not realize the vast majority of the rest of the world thinks the US is a bullshit circus.

The amount of stink this last 10 years has left on the US is going to take a generation to fix. Place is a fucking laughing stock, and rightly so. It's a joke, and the rest of the world knows it.
