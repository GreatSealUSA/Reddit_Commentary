They have no desire to end the mocking because it is the stimulation that Putin has fed the nation since March 2013 and they find it thrilling.

Punishing with deportation is March 2013 onward MAGA values. Going after women is MAGA values.

> Prizing deport as punishment is Putinsim since year 2013. "a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult—to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years—and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection." - 1988, Power of Myth

Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

Post Title:      “I can’t believe this is America”: U.S. Veteran who voted for Trump says ICE arrest of his wife shattered everything he believed  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I don't, I live in a red area of a purple state.

Genuinely imagine the r word stereotype in 1990s TV, how overtly offensive and impaired television would stereotype them, and that genuinely is them on a good day.

Like I am not kidding, they just all misinform each other and believe different iterations of misinformation.

Imagine playing a game of telephone, but over 50 years with all of your neighbors around politics.

Everyone says everyone knows someone impacted by some made up shit, but nobody first hand knows.

"Oh yeah I heard those Somalis eat dogs from my friend"

Who did he hear that from?

"Oh fox too"

Its like a meme beliefs system as a political ideology. They all hear some half baked wrong info, but because of brain drain all the smart people leave so people living in the dying towns are statistically more probable to be the dumbest segment of the pop.

So they all repeat half wrong half truths to each other, over generations with no correction.

It is also why they all call college liberal indoctrination camps.

They all indoctrinate each other since birth because of the facts I laid out, and then when their kid ages to college age and become part of the brain drain effect that child leaves their echo chamber community.

Republicans have had their rural areas be echo chambers for generations.

They realize their parents believe made up shit as reality doesn't line up.

They come back and do not want to entertain made up shit so they push back.

Parents cry that an outside thought has occurred and scream for vengeance against colleges for educating their kids out of their echo chamber

Then they scream they are the majority because the system that weaponizes their ignorance artificially empowers them to be worth more than educated people in higher concentrated urban areas through an electoral voting system.

Since if the educated became the majority, things would improve and the facade of the legitimacy of that ideology would evaporate.

The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Can you imagine how much time she's spending everyday on makeup, hair, and other cosmetic shit? Hours, without a doubt. I mean 100% she has grey roots and yet she has never let them be seen. Surprisingly enough most CABINET MEMBERS are very busy people and they don't normally have time for Kris Kardashian\-style beauty routines. So in addition to being a puppy murdering psychopath and Nazi cosplayer she is also definitely not actually fulfilling her job duties.

How hilarious and amusing, laughing away. That's what Surkov students exploit in the Reddit audience. Blowing minds with surreal / absurd comedy. President Tony Clifton performances. Thinking it is accidental that the Kremlin and White House use media this way. Reddit users... [eating the Surkovian Onions](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). People entirely unable to turn to nonfiction and learn what Trump is following.. Putin / Russia / Surkov students.

As somebody commented about him at the last Nürnberg party congress, since the time of Mohammed nothing like it has been seen in this world. His body does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable. ... So you see, Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity or, even better, a myth." - Doctor Carl G Jung. During an interview with H. R.

Gavin Newsom isn't the Leftist that main stream media paints him to be.

He has very strong anti homeless agendas (as in "get the fuck out"), loves the ultra wealthy, and many other things i can't think of right now.

He's essentially the "fiscally conservative, publicly liberal" that Republicans were in the 90s.

Reminder: California has the death penalty, and some of the strictest pro\-police laws, and Newsom never goes after them

I think the real problem is that too many people think we can just wait Trump out and vote someone better in. It's too fucking late for that. *Way* too much damage has happened already. We need drastic change and no Democrat is going to offer that.

It’s actually crazy how many people dismissed Project 2025 during the run up to the election. 

Either they didn’t believe it could be done, it was being exaggerated, the trust in the courts would limit it, they wouldn’t actually go through with it, etc. 

I’m glad some people are now starting to realize but the Heritage Foundation has been writing the script for Republican candidates for over 3 generations now. They’ve slowly shaped the country into what it is now from the local level all the way to the federal government and every legislature and court system they can. 

It always should have been taken seriously.

Joe supports Rape. Supports Child Rape. Supports Child Sex Trafficking.

Bored of people defending this crap. This isn't over. When Vance takes over next year, people will defend him when he slows down what Donald is doing. People will say he is a good choice.

Because billionaires advertise on Reddit media and people do not want to confront media ecology. Marshall McLuhan education and teaching from University of Toronto has been abandoned to the general public. Billionaires have ensured that Marshall McLuhan's 1970' public education is not applied to Rupert Murdoch's public education systems since October 7, 1996. Media ecology is the absent education in a working healthy democracy. Reddit user is calling out the problem but not offering education and teaching and learning **for adults** as a solution. We can rescue USA from Putin's Internet Research Agency... if we stop commenting all on different pages of Reddit and get on serious important topics, *the same page*.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

That’s really not true. Military power isn’t the only power. 

Soft power exists, there is oodles of options available to other countries \- when Canada stopped buying American booze, shit got hard for him. 

When China stopped exporting because of the tariffs, shit got hard for him. 

A coordinated effort, by a few key countries could easily make life hard for the old dough boy. 

But they probably aren’t going to do that. (Because half of your country still supports him \- and don’t need the headache of relation from those nutters) \- fix your own backyard and maybe others will play ball, and that’s making those supporters realise how bad it’s got.

Media addicts have been sitting on their ass waiting for this episode of the Reality White House / Reality Kremlin TCP/IP media show to stream to the intimate touch-device screens. No call to stand up to the media crap Trump keeps dropping into the mounts of the Reddit audience. Instead, just commenting like it is a television show or film or sports game to gawk at.

This Reddit messaging **is calling Trump "mentally ill" in low-effort** comment style (very popular on Reddit January 2026) that people find "engaging" / "engagement" to Trump topics. Reddit profits off this... addicts to mocking Trump. Addicts to calling Trump "mentally ill" without actually asking We The People to *come together* to remove Trump leadership. No off-Reddit URL, no doctors cited, no books quoted. This is inside the billionaire media systems, Reddit, to just comment and not educate and teach intelligent intellectual serious topics.

There is zero self-awareness that Donald Trump is first and foremost an entertainer and SNL and Jimmy Kimmel performer, comedy.

This isn't satire or irony, this has gone on for over a FULL DECADE of media addicts flocking to Trump's Tony Clifton SNL content! This is "eating the onion", eating up Trump shit.

Say the quiet part louder. If you disagree with our policy you must be silenced.

Trump is starting WW3 and the 2nd American Civil War, and if you wonder why, just pretend he's a Russian asset and it all makes sense.

Kash has been a failure. No clarity on Epstein. No arrests on Russia hoax, Fedsurrection or gain\-of\-function. Hardly anybody in that whole corrupt agency has been fired. He talked big and then decided he liked the swamp just fine.

> Reddit is the Trump fandom. PAY ATTENTION HERE: A speech, distributed by media networks (TCP/IP Internet medium) made by President Donald J. Trump is the trigger for this topic. Trump is the SOURCE of something to comment about. That's the media ecology perspective of Trump the entertainer, actor, President *Tony Clifton* performances. The more odd, unusual, errors and wild claims he makes, the more Reddit audience falls in line (and the Twitter media empire screenshot mocking away).

Out-group hate immigrants mind-fucking of Surkov students. Antics politics. REDDIT society is not resisting this and is a FANDOM of "making the best jokes" of Trump, making the best of a horrible Trump situation. But that's the problem. The same free time and spare time could be used to comment over and over and over: Dr. Bandy X Lee and quotes from her October 3, 2017 book. It is the avoidance of relevant nonfiction books (on paper) that is my media ecology emphasis of the Reddit audience / fandoms to Trump.

If some of this lecture has seemed a little weird or to go a little too far, it’s because I don’t want to reduce quite all of this to slogans.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Trump:

“The people will start supporting the Patriots of ICE, instead of the highly paid troublemakers, anarchists, and agitators!”

He's gone so far in the direction of bold\-faced absurdity, "comic\-book villain" can no longer reasonably characterize him. He's an infinitely dangerous clown who is merely a useful puppet of horrible billionaires.

Worst President in US history and certainly one of the worst people in the US today.

> This is simulation of resistance. Trump is telling the Reddit audience exactly what the Reddit audience already believes: "Always follow the money", the blind and never-questioned faith that money motivates all terrorism. That being paid money is the motivation for terrorist. It just is not true. Rupert Murdoch does not PAY MONEY to his audience of Fox News. the mot loyal voters and killers are those who believe in fiction story telling. The Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon are all science FICTION stories. And fandom of the fantasy stories PAY MONEY to the Temple, Mosque, Synagogue, Church, cinema, venue. People pay for fiction. People are attracted to fiction. 
> 
> Donald Trump is creating a fiction that protesters are motivate by payment an money. Reddit is attracted to this fiction storytelling. People are eating right out of the hands of Surkov students. The answer is to teach cult deprogramming, to not just say "cult", but actually start heating nonfiction books about cults.
> 
> You better teach hard and stand up for what you believe in. Education of authentic learning and teaching about flaws in the human mind. Because the Roman Empire in year 380 adopted science fiction Bible as a way to lead a society - and the USA in year 2026 still has science fiction church venues all over the nation. Fox News fiction storytelling, Newsmax fiction storytelling, Reddit fiction storytelling still outsells any kind of nonfiction Wikipedia or nonfiction in general.
