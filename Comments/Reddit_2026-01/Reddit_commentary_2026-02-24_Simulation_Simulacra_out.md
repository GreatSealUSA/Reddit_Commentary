Please let this somehow flood mainstream media with irrefutable evidence of what this degenerate has done. We all want to see him go quickly and fight the next battle to save our “democracy”

REDDIT_TOP_COMMENT_YOUNG_ACCOUNT The posting title "Now Please" is generic, meaningless Reddit community originated clickbait get gets people to open the image to see the topic. The /r/TrendoraX subreddit was created in July 2025, the user account created in July 2025. Trump fandom images of Donald Trump. Pro-Trump messaging "We all want to see him go quickly and fight the next battle" AMUSEMENT_COMEDY_WASHING_TRUMP_AS_FUNNY_MEDIA_SANEWASHING There is a call for the "mainstream media", but not Reddit media to cite nonfiction avoided books from Dr. Bandy X Lee and have Trump removed ASAP.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Everytime this article is posted in various forms i.e. they deported my wife/husband/kids or destroyed my business/town/home they essentially admit by the end of the article that they would vote for them again. 

It's a nonsensical dissociation from reality that I will never understand.

No call to intellectual arms, no remedial morality lessons, just commenting about the Reddit vibes fandom of Twitter billionaire Elon Musk MAGA media systems.
