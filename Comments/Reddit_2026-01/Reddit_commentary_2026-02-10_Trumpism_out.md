I assume he also wants to paint it gold and rename it to Trump Bridge.

The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

Spoiler Alert: Trump himself approved this project in 2017\.

From wikipedia (and links to some articles): In a joint statement released after a meeting between newly elected U.S. president[Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)and Canadian prime minister[Justin Trudeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau)on February 13, 2017, the two governments reiterated the support of the "expeditious completion" of the project.[\\44])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#cite_note-44)It was listed as a priority infrastructure project by the Donald Trump administration.

Edit: In the spirit of facts (as an other redditor once said, this project apparently at least goes back to the Bush Administration. The Obama Administration also had some involvement in the project.

I live in an ultra conservative state surrounded by diehard Trump supporters. Not a single one of my neighbors, according to them, watched the Kid Rock “take my ball and go home” show. Even the guy who flies the Trump 2028 and Don’t Tread On Me flags says he didn’t bother watching it.

My top three favorite comments about Kid Rock’s show: 

3 \- Lollapaloser

2 \- Hillbilly Vanilli, and 

1 \- Peckerwoodstock

Honorable mention goes to the person who put up side\-by\-side photos of Kid Rock and Ricky Martin and pointed out that they’re the same age.

It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

Part of song: Trans kids suck/don't exist!

Later part of same sang: You know people just don't like me and I don't know why?!

I can probably think of a few reasons.

The whole thing is such a delightful debacle. Who is TPUSA's core constituency: high school and college age young adults. And this is the age that finds this sort of stuff so cringe. They're making their own brand radioactive. Or at least more radioactive than it was.

> If you **truly want to understand what is going on in USA** since year 2013, study this behavior on Reddit. DELIGHTED people to have hate in their life. To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing. You have to take the media ecology addiction to hate seriously, study the Middle East. I moved to Amman, Jordan during the Arab Spring Syria War outbreak in March 2011 to study media ecology of *hate for hate* fandoms. *Hate harder* competitive hate faith of Reddit users.

Always the passport, always the “dokumenti!” **You can get stopped and checked for papers at any moment**. It might only actually happen once or maybe even twice a year, but you still have to stand in queues and knock on doors to obtain the whole library of little stamps, regulations, permits — the legal stipulations and requirements that are themselves always changing. A little trick to keep you always on tenterhooks, always patting your pockets for your papers, always waking up worried that you might have lost them in a bar. Over time you begin to pat for the passport instinctively, your hand going down unthinkingly to check your pocket so many times a day you don’t even notice any more.
