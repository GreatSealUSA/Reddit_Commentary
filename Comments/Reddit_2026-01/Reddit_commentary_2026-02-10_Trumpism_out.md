I assume he also wants to paint it gold and rename it to Trump Bridge.

The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Spoiler Alert: Trump himself approved this project in 2017\.

From wikipedia (and links to some articles): In a joint statement released after a meeting between newly elected U.S. president[Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)and Canadian prime minister[Justin Trudeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau)on February 13, 2017, the two governments reiterated the support of the "expeditious completion" of the project.[\\44])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#cite_note-44)It was listed as a priority infrastructure project by the Donald Trump administration.

Edit: In the spirit of facts (as an other redditor once said, this project apparently at least goes back to the Bush Administration. The Obama Administration also had some involvement in the project.

I live in an ultra conservative state surrounded by diehard Trump supporters. Not a single one of my neighbors, according to them, watched the Kid Rock “take my ball and go home” show. Even the guy who flies the Trump 2028 and Don’t Tread On Me flags says he didn’t bother watching it.

3 \- Lollapaloser

Honorable mention goes to the person who put up side\-by\-side photos of Kid Rock and Ricky Martin and pointed out that they’re the same age.

It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers.

In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

The whole thing is such a delightful debacle. Who is TPUSA's core constituency: high school and college age young adults. And this is the age that finds this sort of stuff so cringe. They're making their own brand radioactive. Or at least more radioactive than it was.

To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing.

Kevin asks Trump how to get to the lobby and Trump tells him it's down the hall and to the left. Yet in the next shot Kevin is clearly turning right from the hall into the lobby. 

This is a subtle reference to the fact that Trump is a liar.

Why can't immigration officers do it the right way? That's the question. I know this sounds harsh, but it's not harsh words that are astounding... it's the harsh tactics of ICE and CPB.

Delia Ramirez is my rep. My own neighborhood has been gassed by ICE and CPB. They fly black hawks above my neighborhood. They scare my children and make us feel unsafe. My wife has joined a neighborhood group to help escort children home from our neighborhood grade school, aware of the tactics of kidnapping children in order to entrap their parents. I have personal friends who were arrested at their own immigration hearings, sent to Texas and then released months later in the middle of nowhere, without their possessions. ICE and CPB are a terrorist organization, funded by the federal government.

Then they also turn around and say they believe whatever dhs is claiming about immigrants, and that the people DHS is breaking the law to get, are breaking the law so it’s okay.

Well, yes, the photos are obviously not AI, but this point kinda doesn't matter because AI can just generate a photo that looks like it was taken a long time ago.

Think about this. We have portrait photos of people that were taken over a hundred years ago, but we don't know a) the photographer's name, b) the subject of the photo's name, c) where it was taken, d) the exact year it was taken.

Up until recently, we KNEW that the picture was real and was taken so long ago just by virtue of its existence. Even though we barely know anything about it, we still know it is what it claims to be. *We have left this era of truth.* 

What seperates a legitamate photograph like that with one that somebody generated? It is already almost impossible to distinguish them and it will only become more difficult. Photographs are no longer a shortcut to the truth. We have to view everything with scrutiny.

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the **Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President** in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid ease—a nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism—and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

He's the son of an Italian father who grew up under Mussolini and an African American mother born and raised in Jim Crow era Alabama. Something tells me he was raised with plenty of stories about the worst of humanity, and in his own life I'm sure he saw plenty of it himself. He knows what he's talking about, and he's not wrong.

And fine, I think Malala's year 2013 book captures several authors and what needs to be said. If ANYTHING, I would fault Malala for not pointing to  Elif Şafak and her library of public lectures, writing, etc. If Malala wants to be into popular sports, fashion, a celebrity - so be it.

But we don't need 5,000 Greta Thunberg - we need billions of EVERYDAY people quoting: Dr. Bandy X Lee, quoting Malala, quoting Greta's 2019 book, quoting Banksy's book, quoting Elif Şafak.

Silly rabbit. 

When a white man goes into work/school/mall and murders a dozen people, it's thoughts and prayers time, some twaddle about mental health, and suggestions it might be a leftist false flag.

If a non\-white , non\- Christian, non\-5th generation American commits an act of violence, it's the fault of the entire said community, and a harbinger of future waves of similar attacks. 

The script writes itself.

This is what White House says "radical x-wing terrorists", and Reddit messaging is repeating what the billionaire media systems tell people to parrot and repeat. ["You might have come across the articles (“I Lost My Dad to Fox News” / “Lost Someone to Fox News?” / “‘Fox News Brain’: Meet the Families Torn Apart by Toxic Cable News”), or the Reddit threads, or the support groups on Facebook, as people have sought ways to mourn loved ones who are still alive. The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

Let’s look at political parties for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that **in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions**. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”. Now it’s not that the Democrats are doing any better, I don’t guess that’s news. I mean, Clinton is now less popular than Castro. If Castro ran against Clinton, Clinton would lose by a few points. I mean, he wouldn’t lose big, but he would lose, you know, by a few points. I mean, especially in a three person race with Clinton, Castro, Perot and Gaddafi. I mean, I don’t know who would win. In fact, given this postmodern world any one of the four could emerge with the biggest one fourth depending on how they ran their campaign. Probably it would depend on who could hire David Gergen \[crowd laughter\]. I mean, if Fidel got to Gergen first, he might win the damn thing, we don’t know. But the Democrat’s response to this “tax and spend” is “No we don’t, nah nah na-nah nah: invest” **This is political debate in a democracy. No it’s not. It’s the simulation of politics**." - Texan Rick Roderick

Nobody is asking questions because there's already an answer, a MAGA person shot someone because they criticised Trump

I get the point he's making but it's a false equivalence. A father killing his daughter over politics in America is not only out of the ordinary but it's wild enough to be a big news story all over the world. 

Also \- and I know he's being facetious \- he's wildly misrepresenting both western culture and the Christian religion. I'm not sure why. But I can probably guess.

This is the thing about the honor killing fixation that gets me. It's fucking horrible, but it's also hardly unique to Muslims. There are a lot of LGTBQ corpses from conservative Christian families that were found under similar circumstances.

The coverage on this is misleading but something fucking fishy is going on with this case, 100%. 

He owns the gun, his prints are on it, it was used in the killing of his daughter, they were alone together, and somehow there’s not enough evidence to convict on manslaughter? 

Can anybody honestly buy that at face value?

Just a way to *look down* and *punch down* on Texas people that have been manipulated by powerful billionaire Rupert Murdoch into a cult of media Fox News HDTV.

If you really want to find more about any claims you read here or anywhere we should always try to find more about it. 
Here is one source, and you can find more if you really look for it

CSIS evidence points to more left\-wing activity overall, often directed at conservative or Republican\-aligned targets, amid a decline in right\-wing violence.
Also see all the “peaceful” protests where they burn businesses, destroy property and kill speakers for open mic discussions….

A 10\-mile radius shutdown from the surface up to 18k feet is massive. Citing 'Special Security Reasons' without any further clarification for a city of 700k people is naturally going to lead to wild speculation. The fact that it's labeled a military TFR and doesn't even list a point of contact for the controlling authority is what makes this feel different from a standard VIP or POTUS restriction

The additional closure about 15 miles west of Santa Teresa, NM is the more concerning part to me. Looking at B4Ufly, it is a huge trapezoid covering a large swath of desert. This area was a known smuggling route through the Wilderness Areas and National Monument before the DOD was given control of the BLM land between highway 9 and Mexico.

I’m on the East Coast but I’m feeling a bit nervous. My heart goes out to anybody in El Paso who’s currently terrified.

I have 3 possible reasons from least likely to most likely: 

1. The government has received credible intelligence of an imminent terror attack in the area.
2. The military is about to attack cartels in Mexico, possibly with surface to surface missiles, and doesn't want civilian planes getting hit by accident.
3. Some judge has ordered that Ice needs to fly a detainee back to Minnesota and released, so now ice can claim they can't comply because there's a no\-fly zone.

It's not like Trump has cared anything about the law until this point.

The detachment from the real world is so extreme that people can not grasp what has happened. The attacking of Canada, being abusive to people for kindness, wasn't a "red flag" enough for Reddit audiences to maybe say the ENTIRE ROOM, the entire NATION is compromised, and that maybe just maybe gaslighting actually WORKS. Not just saying "gas lighting", but that the manipulation is not just one person fucking with a partner in a house - but an organized crime technique with all the most powerful media players in on it!

He wasn’t too much for them, he wasn’t going to pass senate confirmation because he was under active investigation for sex trafficking minors and wouldn’t get the votes from moderates.

So while Matt would have been a better choice for Trump given his willingness to hide sex crimes, Bondi was a pretty good second choice given her willingness to drop the fraud investigation into Trump University in exchange for a $25k political donation.

Yep. He's been trying to cover up his involvement in a decades long child sex trafficking and rape ring. Gaetz was easily pliable and likely guilty himself hence him being first choice. Bondi was AG of FL when the cover up began, Trump wasn't sure she was as craven as she is but she's just as "evil" as he is and she'll do *anything* to cover for him and her crimes while she was FL's AG.

Unfortunately it took 9 years of non\-stop "lefty" pressure to convince the media (including much of the media on the left) that it wasn't a conspiracy and Trump was indeed *deep* in to international child sex trafficking.

In my high school, Snider High in Fort Wayne Indiana - I distinctly remember year 1984 and 1985 etc. listening to girls talk to each other about the older men that were giving them gifts and secret affairs. Since I was a book nerd reading in class all the time, they talked right in front of me and I never once was accused of spreading rumors or sharing secrets. Reddit constantly cracks jokes about what it is like in Ohio with men manipulating boys. My mother is from Ohio, my father is from Ohio, my two brothers are from Ohio. https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/11/in-new-documentary-former-ohio-state-wrestlers-say-u-s-rep-jim-jordan-knew-about-strauss-abuse/ The abuse men do **to other men** and girls younger than them is suburban Ohio and Indiana - and I expect all over USA. It isn't just wealthy billionaires. Hot girls in my high school classrooms were not afraid to discuss their "weekend and night outings" at age 14 and age 15. But men DO NOT LISTEN. Men do not READ BETWEEN THE LINES. People in my high school couldn't read between the lines of hot girls talking any more than reading between the lines of Shakespeare or James Joyce! People were too busy fixated on keeping balls in rectangle lines as competition. The hot age 14 and age 15 girls were targeted and prized by charming men over age 30!

The USA is imploding into an explosion, the caloric density of meme-think Twitter-length short-message mind patterns, circling between media platform to media platform (media ocean to media ocean, medium to medium, media ecology to media ecology, media environment to media environment at higher and higher reaction twitching speeds). Cramming neurodiversity nation into tiny-think Apple iPhone meme screen images. We The People on Reddit, as programmed by the Saint Petersburg IRA, have boiled away all the water of life to simplistic bare wires.

You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and **behavioristic psychology, that we’re nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli**. This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life." - age 83, published year 1988.

It's all making more sense why trump appointed everyone in the current administration. It's safe to assume they were all involved and are part of a pact to bury the truth. 

He has built a defensive wall of collaborative pedophiles who now run the government.

She literally brought a 'burn book' of insults to a congressional oversight hearing regarding the protection of child sex traffickers! If the strategy is to make the DOJ so unprofessional that impeachment feels like a 'political hit' rather than a basic accountability measure, it’s working.

It may have started with Twitter and Trump cultists July 6, 2011 https://theOutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 but it has grown since January 2024 to be EVERYONE in cults of hate. Deepest faith in mocking. Deepest faith in total mockery back and forth MAGA to anti-MAGA, MAGA to Canada, etc. Reddit and Bluesky are cults of MAGA mocking, ICE insulting, hate messaging. Hate corrupts perspective of the forest for the trees, people are comparatively focused on the out-group. Surkov won.

Difference is Dedra was loyal and selfless to the empire even if the empire was evil. She believed in the concept of order.

Bondi is incompetent and loyal to only a handful of evil cronies and doesn’t actually care about the US or any notion of order.

> TRUMP_FANDOM Why are these "rebels" on Reddit commenting section not being serious and organizing a Reddit-initiated rebellion? REDDIT_BLACKOUT - why are they not calling for a social media blackout protest which is proven to make headlines all over the world news? COMPREHENDING_TRUMP UNDERSTANDING_TRUMP to comprehend and understand Trump fanatics on Reddit, such as the one making this specific comment, look at how they are wishing for more media content. Trump is a media creator, he is not a valid choice as governor, but Star Wars: Andor is **fiction**, and they are wanting HBO to make more dramafiction content. They do not wish to REMOVE TRUMP, because that cuts off the source of stimulating fiction for their cult addictions to Trumpism / MAGA / Putinism. Surkov won since March 2013.

*Reminder this conversation took place.*

P. Bondi: "Instead of Ghislaine Maxwell, you should be talking about Iryna Zarutska who died on a subway. You don't talk about that."

D. Ross: "I have been talking about it. And actually helping with these issues. We're going to move back to you."

P. Bondi: "I bet we are!"

D. Ross: "Yes, of course. You're here to testify. That's what the whole point of this endeavor is."

***Reminder that Pam Bondi was asked about a child sex trafficking ring operated by Epstein and Maxwell, and wanted to change subject to something completely unrelated at the time, in order to not answer the question, and got angry when the subject didn't change.***

They either don’t have a conscience thus have no issue doing anything for the right price, or they do but they love power and money more than anything else (and they take beta blockers and other drugs to keep that conscience demon away).

I don't like Trump, but he was an FBI informant after 2006\. He was subpoenaed along with a bunch of other Epstein associates and he was the only one who responded (*this all according to the Special Agent*). He literally called them and told them everything he knew, and continued to cooperate with the FBI and snitch for the next 10\+ years. Again, I really don't like Trump, but we can't deny the facts of the situation. I am just waiting for the day when the law applies equally to everyone. I am tired of people getting away with heinous things because they have money.

I've always found it a little suspicious that Trumps choice for AG was the Florida AG whose office has been highly suspect and scrutinized with how they handled the Epstein case.

Pam Bondi, despite being the human trafficking AG, never commented on Epstein publicly during her time as Florida AG, and never investigated him, and never brought charges.

If it wasn't for Julie K. Brown's investigative journalism in the Miami Herald coming out in 2018, it's possible Epstein would never have faced justice.

Maybe her part in the coverup didn't start in 2024\...

Reminder… Pam stole a Hurricane Katrina dog and tried to accuse the elderly couple of neglect(saying a family is neglecting an animal after a major hurricane is fucked in itself) and left the elderly couple in a 16 month legal dispute to keep the dog for herself.

[https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump\-ag\-pick\-pam\-bondi\-125622383\.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-ag-pick-pam-bondi-125622383.html)

Then there is the whole she is great at finding cash cow revenue streams for herself from Qatar as well. 

Before her job at DOJ she was making $115,000 a month from Qatar. 

[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/pam\-bondis\-extensive\-lobbying\-for\-wealthy\-special\-interests\-and\-foreign\-government\-poses\-serious\-conflict\-of\-interest](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/pam-bondis-extensive-lobbying-for-wealthy-special-interests-and-foreign-government-poses-serious-conflict-of-interest)

She will get a raise for protecting the Qatar royal family member Jabor who was scheming with Epstein right up to his arrest in 2019\. 

Don’t forget Qatar wants to build a military base on US soil too. 

There are a lot of Epstein class interests this woman is protecting just so she can destroy the country to protect her foreign cash cow revenue stream.

Post Title:      Conservative Influencer Erika Kirk Faces Grooming Allegations After Alleged Messages to Teen Surfaces  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
This person is a scary piece of work. She straight\-up lied in that TV interview saying she had no ex\-boyfriends, when you can readily find photos of her on Instagram with.... her ex\-boyfriend, who now does Turning Point speeches about "How to be like Charlie" and I wish that was a joke. Not to mention the dating show she went on. 

She met Charlie Kirk when he interviewed her for a job at Turning Point. Now she owns it.

Oh no. When I first saw one of her emails (before I knew who it was) I thought it was completely unhinged. I’m not even going to pretend they weren’t BUT she’s been through a lot so I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be in her shoes. She can be as unhinged as she wants until people are held accountable.

Watch Filthy Rich on HBO. The detectives in Florida who investigated Epstein before and after he was convicted said they were told, "Well, he is a celeb". Meaning these people can do anything they want to do, and law authorities who really want to bring people to justice can not.

Instead of doing a serious sustained REDDIT_BLACKOUT and BLUESKY_BLACKOUT and making world press coverage calling for Trump to be removed. People keep acting as if a 15 entertainment show at the Super Bowl was a bit "gotcha" protest. Simulation between Kid Rock and Bad Bunny is corporate profit making, selling music, selling advertising for Jody Allen's team profit brand growth. The macro economics of this "diss track" behavior are great, just like last year Super Bowl "diss track" simulations. Reddit audience is entertained to see Kid Rock defeated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_Bowl these days (2026 iPad iPhone era) people have a dozen screens in front of them at family gatherings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_counterprogramming

They haven't really paid much attention to actual Trump in years, really. But also notable that their information system barely shows them Trump either. Fox et al often talk over him and lets chyrons tell their viewers what to think. The most the average maga sees of him is clips and commentary that cuts around the obvious, striking decline. 

For the most part, maga only needs there to be "TRUMP" in power as a sort of self\-soothing axiom. They don't otherwise give a shit about anything as long as "TRUMP"

These people should not have this kind of power to begin with. Having this power and abusing it is wrong. Abusing this power while not knowing and understanding how to use it is even more scary.

On a lighter note the incompetence is very laughable and I hope it digs their own graves.

For me, it’s mainly just the fact HE NEVER BRINGS IT UP. He constantly mentions Hilary, Obama, Biden. But if he actually got shot at, Trump being Trump wouldn’t shut the fuck up about it. “I got shot at defending this country, what a great country it is, the best country, it was a very bad bullet, only hit my ear, very SAD, doctors said wow i can’t believe your ears are so strong Mr President, I know, I said to them, can you believe what I said, I said, and mind you Doctors listen to me as I’ve given so much to the New Trump Healthcare plan, I’ve always had such strong ears” etc…

as a society we need to stop acting like there’s something inherently wrong with being “conservative” or “liberal” or “leftist”. Those things are all valid viewpoints when you remove all the other shit from it. There IS something very fucking wrong with being a pedophile, a rapist, a grifter, a crony, a narcissist, and a criminal who abuses the government in order to evade justice and rob entire populations of their basic human rights. You can be a conservative without supporting Donald Trump. You can historically vote for right\-wing parties and still vote against any right\-wing politician that doesn’t share your values if the circumstances call for it. We all need to stop treating politics like it’s a spectator sport that requires loyalty from its fans. Please feel free to change your voting patterns in all future elections if you want to.

If it were a real event he would remind people of it constantly. But he wasn't even willing to pretend to have a tiny chunk taken out of his ear to sell it. Ears don't heal with no mark \- especially at his age and even in the short timeframe it was bandaged with a *HUGE* ridiculous rectangular dressing.

Which is such a glaring plot hole that if clear clues of a staged assassination attempt happened to anyone else, his supporters would be pointing it out. This is a JFK magic bullet level clue, but they are blind to it.

The flag being lowered and photographers repositioned should have been raising alarm bells to hell and back.

Don't know about "we". Many of the files in some form or another have been out for over a decade. Anyone actually into conspiracies knew Trump was a pedophile that colluded with elites and Epstein, and, if you didn't know that much, you should have at least known he was a crook only interested in himself.

If you paid any attention at all, these files comes at almost 0 surprise in terms of content. The only thing that is new are some names of conspirators. But the tribalism is too strong and this disgusting bastard gets elected anyway. Republicans vs Democrats when it was always Elites vs Populace. You've been brainwashed into the culture war when it was always a war of power.

Trump will be dead before he sees a jail cell, so there's nothing to really fight for. Only his name will be tarnished. But who cares? He got to rape kids and double his net worth to leave to his family before he is granted the sweet release of an ordinary death. He won the game of life.

The number of people who believe that it was staged is staggering. No proof, no evidence — just a shot in the dark. Yet the same people don’t believe that 2020 was stolen, even with thousands of affidavits, veteran workers blowing the whistle, massive irregularities, mail\-in voting, ballot harvesting… We’re going to know the truth soon with the FBI’s seizure of Fulton County’s 2020 ballots.

> Why was there no REDDIT_BLACKOUT Reddit blackout in September 2024 to let the world know that We the  People do not support Donald Trump? I saw Trump signs all over in places I have lived and traveled and can identify real attitudes and behaviors. The cult of Fox News HDTV in 2024 and cult of Newsmax HDTV was as strong as ever 2024. Reddit fandom can not face up to their own cult of stimulation that Trump provides. Why are people not protesting on Reddit any time in year 2025? January 2026? The denial of the importance of We The People and intelligence and defending against Russian information warfare. 
> 
> The Founding Fathers did not have color photography in year 1776. Media has dramatically changed since year 2007 when the Apple iPhone 1 was introduced. Reddit cult of media can not see that Trump is a cult leader that Reddit follows every hour of every day. This movement is way bigger than election days and into the very social fabric of society of men hating upon women. Why is Reddit society not promoting woman leader Dr. Bandy X Lee? Woman leader Jen Senko?
> 
> Women like Pam Bondi are hated and mocked constantly. Why is it when a serious nonfiction leader like Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee are leading towards good directions, Reddit and Blueksy do not follow the women? AOC is very entertaining and engages is mocking that Reddit prizes. Attraction to mocking back and forth with antics politics is the pattern of what captures attention of fandoms.
> 
> Reddit community can not face that Reddit is heavily influenced by billionaire media owners and the investment billionaires have made in media in general. And that is what Trump has spent decades focused on, being *on camera* more than anyone, being the center of Reddit attention more than anyone with antics and odd behavior. Mocking more than anyone, Reddit's (community, audience) attraction to mockery and avoidance of serious Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction.
> 
> Reddit will not call for impeachment and blackouts of social media - because the attraction to mocking and insulting Trump is stronger than the desire to REMOVE Trump and educate and teach people remedial morality and why it is dangerous to be in a media cult (Reddit media cults) of fiction.

For this remains the common, everyday psychology: **the Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid ease — a nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next**; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism—and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

We don't need more debate and arguing, we need to recognize the addiction to Trump as a content source is a problem both Joe Rogan and Reddit both share.

Why are Republicans so anti\-American that all they do is find ways the government can kill as many good people as possible?


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> ANSWER: Reddit users are avoidant of nonfiction learning. Instead, people are engaged in REACTING to CDC actions by the White House. People on Reddit are REACTING to Republican political party and Kremlin political organized crimes. People using social media systems are NOT turning to Dr. Bandy X Lee as a leader and quoting her nonfiction books and articles. ANY NATION in the entire world could be elevating Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 contributors from her October 3, 2017 book. But the entire world is failing to take mental health of the White House seriously as a educational teaching topic.

Exactly, their entire world view just flipped inside out from everything they’ve been conditioned to believe. It’s not gonna change overnight but when Dear Leader keeps coming up as they dig further into those redactions it’s going to get harder and harder to deny. Eventually they’ll split into camps “fake story (pedophile protectors)” and “We were lied to by the monster we feared (aWOKEn)”.

I'm really fucking tired of people being shocked, surprised, or alarmed by anything this administration does.  
 If you spent 2016\-2022 living in a cabin in Alaska, maybe January\-February 2026 was shocking and surprising.  
 To anyone with a pulse, eyes, and a vague sense of decency, this has been blatantly obvious for the better part of a decade. 

Stop giving empty words about "shock" and "distaste" 

Be pissed. Be furious. The time for politeness is over. This administration is corrupt and focused on destroying anything resembling normal democracy. They've defied the courts, international law, and centuries of treaties and diplomacy.

BE FUCKING PISSED

The alternative to joking is crying about the fact that the US was ever allowed to get to this point in first place.

No, how she behaves is in no way how a normal criminal would behave. Criminals, in general, fear being outed as criminals and being caught. They fear the law and those authorities who enforce those laws. Bondi doesnt act this way, and that's the point OP was trying to make, a point that I also agree with. And it's not just her, it's the entire administration.

There are plenty of gun owning liberals around that are ticked off enough to fight, but thankfully most are not so rash and uneducated as to give this current administration an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act before November.

Just because people on the left don't make it their whole persona doesn't mean they don't exist.

Meanwhile, many of our Democrat Politicians are currently pushing some of the most invasive gun control yet, that will disproportionally effect the responsible left.

> When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways.

> Every subreddit of Reddit is an "alternate universe", alternate reality game of fiction fandoms. Thousands and thousands of Fox News entertainment-style communities as subreddits. This was published more than a decade ago, but Reddit society repulses nonfiction media analysis:

> * “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

Dr. Bandy X Lee assembled 27 people and published a book October 3, 3017 that every Reddit user should be quoting, linking, citing - but it rots on the shelf and people are drawn to commenting over and over all on different pages and not getting on the same pages of very important nonfiction books on paper.

This is like telling a grocery store that they have to offer specific tabloids to shoppers. It's not the government's place to do that, it's not even in the public's best interest, it's propagandizing.

Of course, Apple *will* do it, because they've invested too much in sucking up to the orange pedo to back down now.

Breitbart invented the modern fake news model. Take a little news tidbit then exaggerate it into a full blown distorted story. They can't be trusted, they're the experts in making shit up.


> [!NOTE]

> IGNORANCE_CELEBRATIONS on Reddit comment section. "Breitbart News Network was created in mid-2007 by American conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart." **Fox News went online October 7, 1996** - Putin's birthday which is is more than a decade BEFORE Breitbart network. The very Reddit posting title mentions Fox News. Rupert Murdoch has been doing global media systems like this all over the world. Neil Postman's book, "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about television news - published in year 1985 was already raising very serious and important concerns. Just like Reddit memes do in year 2026:
> 
> NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:
> 
> Neil Postman, year 1985: "We may surmise that the ninety million Americans who watch television every night also think so. But what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience. Our television set keeps us in constant communion with the world, but it does so with a face whose smiling countenance is unalterable. The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that **all subject matter is presented as entertaining**, which is another issue altogether."
> 
> Neil Postman, year 1985: "To say it still another way: **Entertainment is the supra-ideology of all discourse on television. No matter what is depicted or from what point of view, the overarching presumption is that it is there for our amusement and pleasure**. That is why even on news shows which provide us daily with fragments of tragedy and barbarism, we are urged by the newscasters to “join them tomorrow.” What for? One would think that several minutes of murder and mayhem would suffice as material for a month of sleepless nights. We accept the newscasters’ invitation because we know that **the “news” is not to be taken seriously, that it is all in fun**, so to say. Everything about a news show tells us this — the good looks and amiability of the cast, their pleasant banter, the exciting music that opens and closes the show, the vivid film footage, **the attractive commercials** — all these and more suggest that what we have just seen is no cause for weeping. A news show, to put it plainly, is a format for entertainment, not for education, reflection or catharsis."

State media is here, just wearing like 10 badges at their point. It's all the same.

> RECENCY_BIAS Recency bias abounds on Reddit comment section. Adults do not educate themselves with nonfiction on these critical and serious topics and are attracted to creating extremely low-effort commenting on important concerns. "State media is here", this was spelled out in year 1985 that entertainment seeking fandoms like Reddit audience behaves... is far more concerned with amusements and tech /r/Technology diversions.

> * "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. **The President does not have the press under his thumb**. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by tech**nological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
> * * Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

> ANSWER: a nation of commenting addicts and like-button toching addicts, upvote-button addicts... people who avoid nonfiction learning for adults. We The People of the USA have abandoned nonfiction in favor of low-effort commenting on page after page of social media systems. Trump is a media addict leading  nation of media addictions. Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit can't face the addiction problems and have a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest to demonstrate that We The People are the power of society - and instead people keep making shit-commenting and shit-postings and AMUSEMENT_AS_USUAL with entertainment and memes. No matter how horrific it has gotten, Reddit users can't call to get on the same page of critical and important nonfiction topics. GTA6 news and Steam sales is more a Reddit fandom concern that having an Internet protest to remove Trump and put Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 people front and center regarding MAGA cult.

Yeah right. Nobody will do anything. 

Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings early Saturday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Authorities have also identified a suspect who is still at large.

That’s what people say but history shows at least a couple dozen examples that resistance to fascism is almost never successful once it’s taken root in a substantial manner. 

“Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, **thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow**.

This hesitation is driven not only by fear of standing alone but also by genuine uncertainty, which grows over time rather than diminishes. The absence of visible protest, even in the form of public slogans, reinforces the illusion of widespread acceptance, making dissent seem irrational or alarmist. As a result, individuals remain isolated in their concerns, with colleagues dismissing them as pessimistic or neurotic.

The expectation that a single, dramatic event would galvanize collective resistance proves false, as the regime’s descent into oppression unfolds through a series of incremental, often imperceptible steps. This gradual erosion of resistance means that by the time the full horror becomes undeniable, it is too late to act effectively”

> it's gonna be the modern\-day equivalent of pitchforks and torches right after that.

None of these problems are personal enough to people on the individual level for the average American person to care enough to do anything. You'll get some angry social media comments talking about what an outrage it is and how it's time to do something, a couple of days of some people protesting, and then everyone'll move onto the next issue. It's as predictable as 'thoughts and prayers' by this point. 

'I have to go to work', 'It's too hard to organise everyone like that', 'What can the average person even do if they're not armed?', it'll all be the same thing again, completely planless and hopeless, and *nothing* will get done, and that's the loop America will eternally be trapped in until things get as bad as the scenario I described, if they ever do. Ideally to the assholes on high, the balance will probably be struck that it never gets *quite* that bad, so the people are permanently pacified *just enough* to never actually turn on them. 

Is America content with that? So far the answer has been 'yes', and I predict it will continue to be because that's what modern America has become. Either you're indoctrinated to the point of supporting it, or passive enough to the point that you won't fight it. What's that if not having lost by that point? My heart goes out to America, there are a lot of wonderful individuals there, and they're in just about one of the most evil and tricky circumstances to navigate. The plan has been to foster indifference or passiveness, or to redirect anger to the wrong people, and to have the odds look so unfair that doing anything is almost a death wish, and sadly it's working incredibly well.

I'm all for arguing it out within reason. I don't argue it out with fascist and pedophiles though. The more we treat them as contrary opinions within a democracy the more they will take from us. They will do whatever it takes to get their way. Laws and ethics be damned. 

We can't afford to treat them with grace and justice. Because they do not afford us the same. They must be dealt with by any means necessary. Voting and protests aren't enough. When push comes to shove they will do whatever is necessary. We must do the same. Before it's too late.

Every day of life is a sick society of people commenting over and over and not confronting how Trump is an entertainer playing a "hate me hard" character, Tony Clifton character, and people are media "engaged" and Trump is a bad-ass influencer.

Yeah, I've seen trump supporters and pundits all saying the same thing \- "this *looks* bad". They're not concerned about the child rape. They're not concerned that the administration is covering it up. They're concerned about *the optics*. 

They're not turning on trump. They just haven't gotten their spin yet.

It is there in her blogs, in her writings, in her interviews, in her speeches. But people can not get behind a woke and intelligent girl leader (she was a girl in 2013 when her book was published October 8, 2013).

Headline is misleading. He says it looks terrible for this administration because Trump called it a hoax in the beginning and it turns out to be true. Also, because of all the redactions and who is being protected.

He knew all of this before he helped get Trump elected. Fuck Joe Rogan.

He knew enough in 2017 to completely shut down having Epstein on his show, yet he still simped for that orange turd generator to get him elected.

> “Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.   
> “Don’t be silly,” most answer.   
> “But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”   
> “Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”   
> “So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”   
> “No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”   
> Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and **now they can only create a society of simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work;** the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid easeb—ba nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism — and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

I watched an interview with this specific survivor on Chris Hansens YouTube channel. She talked about how much power Epstein and his associates have and that speaking out would get them killed. She has had people surveilling and following her in her hometown in South Africa. She has extreme PTSD and is terrified that she will be murdered.

Women aren't all "bros". I don't know why society has this perception.

Some of the meanest people in the world are insecure women that want women they perceive as threats (younger, more beautiful, attractive partner, more wealth) to face harm.

One of the biggest voting blocs for for anti\-women's rights are older, conservative women. After talking with many of them, I think they genuinely want people they perceive as younger, more attractive, and happier to suffer.

> * "They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
> Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an **extreme case that we have in the Bible, and our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**." - The Power of Myth, age 83, 1987, published year 1988

Gender aside, we're all human, we should all be more sickened by the horrible things we do to each other. Sometimes "recruiters" start out as trafficking victims so I imagine it might be, in part, relief at being in a slightly safer position of slightly more power. And maybe even a misguided sense of retribution like "this is what they did to me, now it's your turn". It's the cycle of abuse.

My bestie was bullied the way I was. She broke. And when the bullies said she can become part of their group, she chose that safety and came after me with them. Her relief of not being a victim made it happen. The violence had been too much. She explained it to me later. And I could not understand. I even tried to convince her to sort of come back to my side because I missed my friend and my teenage brain could not compute the way it did later. I had the ability to be outraged about it, but all I could feel was the loss. And I think she just did not want to be the victim anymore, she wanted that so bad. (She ran away from a horrible home later on, she had a terrible life. I have no energy to engage into a conversation about having to judge her for what violence her teenage, desperate self enforced into my life....) I am just saying: teenage victims of horror yearn to escape the horror. We all know who Maxwell made to become recruiters: the teenage girls that were already abused and now trapped with the abusers. And abuse makes u crazy.

This is a critical misconception that a majority of people seem to have about the concept of “The Patriarchy” and “Toxic Masculinity” and about misogyny in general.

If there is a hell I truly hope there’s a special spot for collaborators. To choose a, supposed, place of power by selling out your own is especially heinous.
