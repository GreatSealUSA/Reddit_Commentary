I think the irony is that what Krik claimed does not work in the real world.

After a few more ICE murders, sooner or later the people probably will take up firearms. But then the National Guard will step in and will crush them. Trump will probably declare a state of emergency and postpone coming elections.

The people are better of with peaceful protests without using violence or firearms themselves.

Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

Billionaires don't care. They don't care who's in charge. They don't care about any country. They don't care about any people except perhaps the few close to them.

They can live comfortably anywhere. They can buy legislators in any country. They are the shadow dictators that control your lives while we pretend that our elected officials still have some power to represent us.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
As one MAGA supporter put it to me:

> I believe what Trump is doing is trying to terrorise immigrants who are currently here so that they will self deport en masse. Otherwise this country has no hopes of ever going back to being a white country run by whites in a freedom loving manner.

They admit this is a terror campaign and yet they still support it.

White Supremacist Rage is a core tenet of MAGA values. They don't just believe that Whites should be the ruling class, they are filled with fury when ever they see non\-white people. It the non\-whites are poor, they are seen as leeches and beneath contempt, not really fully human. And if the non\-whites are successful, or wealthy, MAGA supporters see them as having taken something from White people \- something that ought to belong solely to Whites.

Trump would relegate non\-whites as permanent second\-class citizens. He is setting up a two\-tier legal system, in which groups of people targeted by Trump are denied access to the legal system used by the rest of the country. This is a common ploy of authoritarians \- because resistance to these attacks on the rule of law is weaker when these changes do not apply to everyone. It is much easier to pretend 'this is fine' when you yourself are not a member of one of the groups being attacked.

[Video discussing two\-tier legal systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99moLo1Hhg#t=15m33s)

Trump's ultimate goal is the same as that of fascists everywhere:

> The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.
> 
> The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.
> 
> They cultivate hate and distrust \[of allies]. They claim to be super\-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. \- Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944\.

Trump would keep all of us working people in eternal subjection \- serving 'the dear leader' and his regime.

[Don't Be A Sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)

> "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." \- Benjamin Franklin

This is not about immigration \- this is an attack on all non\-Whites, and anyone else who opposes fascism.

Take Trump at his word:

['Homegrowns are next': Trump hopes to deport and jail U.S. citizens abroad (April 16, 2025\)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador) 

> President Trump says his administration is actively exploring a proposal to detain U.S. citizens and send them to prisons in El Salvador. Speaking Monday, minutes before a press briefing alongside El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, Trump could be heard embracing the concept.
> 
> "The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You've got to build about five more places," Trump said to Bukele, an apparent reference to prison space that would be needed in El Salvador to house U.S. citizens.

This terrorizing of U.S. Citizens is entirely intentional. 

If you fail to defend other people's rights \- that is how you lose your own.

Her words are literally textbook fascism and abuser. We invade your city with a federal militia under the guise of “making it safer from the criminals and undesirables”. When citizens and innocent people are hurt and killed, and there’s chaos and panic everywhere, we make demands of you to give up your rights in order to be left alone. Demands that have nothing to do with the initial premise of the invasion.

Seriously what does voter rolls, Medicaid, and fraud have to do with immigration? It doesn’t. It’s just a way to get Minnesota and, probably more importantly, other states to bend the knee out of fear this could happen to them.

This. This is how you deploy a force into a civilian city. You don't send in Fallujah\-cosplaying, wannabe pretend soldiers. All masked \& anonymous, carrying automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, putting down the citizens of a US city who are simply exercising their first and second amendment rights.

Maga Republicans may hate us because we're liberal, but we're also 100% tax paying US citizens with exactly the same rights enumerated in the Constitution.

There are a lot of Reddit messages that boil down to: only voting days matter, only 1 single day matters. To fixate so much on voting that dealing with the Kremlin information warfare right not today (Sunday January 25) isn't important... just voting. Putin's military has invaded Internet media systems with manipulation of executive function in the mind. It impacts behavior of society every hour of ever day, on every area of society. Not just voting days, people are conditioned by Russia to hate and self-harm the USA and NATO.

I mean if you only watch a certain news channel, they never talk about any of that. In my chats with my old relatives who only watch one channel, they’re alarmingly uninformed about who Trump is and what all he’s doing. The issue is 1/3 of America is watching propaganda and falling for it

Guys, Kerr obviously doesn’t fuck with ICE or this administration. He’s speaking on a larger scale about how our shared reality has been twisted to the point where something obvious and real happening on video gets called in to question by regular people. It’s a statement of shock and he wants people to always go back to our main principles and ideals. Obviously it would feel good if an NBA coach spit fire and said fuck ICE from the podium but that’s not what Kerr is about. We know he thinks that. He’s already dealt with death and extremism leading to tragedy in his life. He doesn’t want anyone else to be hurt.

There’s nothing confusing about it. We went from “don’t believe what you read online” to “I read it online so it must be true” seemingly overnight.

Fox News is different. It was explicitly designed to be Republican disinfo: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Fox_News>

Lots of copycats since, of course (NewsMax).

Commercial media has issues, too — especially now that they are now all megacorp/billionaire\-owned (and pressured by the criminal Trump admin). But this is not a both sides are the same issue

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases.

The national guard being on the ground at the same time as ICE could mean we are at a critical point in U.S. history. If there is violence between the guard members and ICE it’s a real possibility America does not survive this a country. I could see independence movements in some blue states rise up.

It’s also wild how the same people who feed into the conservative argument have likely carried a concealed weapon themselves and *still* can’t seem to see themselves in the same kind of position Alex was in. Nothing made him different from anyone else who would legally carry a concealed weapon.

I will never understand the mind switch of MTG. She consistently spread some of the cruelest and most false information consistently. And now she starts to publicly speak information that is true. It just shows that most republicans 100% know they spread false information and use the power of human conformity within a group to progress those false ideas.

It's this thing with MAGA, in order to say something true they have to couch it in one of their many lies. The lies are their in\-group language and it's the only way to get any sort of rational thought through the noise. You see it all the time on their sub, it might literally be the best we can hope for from them so I'm not begrudging it.

Sure. But various political and media figures have been saying this for *years*. 

The problem is the public they're saying it to just...says it back to them. Everyone in the world is waiting for the American public to act, but the American public just want to be messengers. Everybody wants to pass the buck, nobody wants to act.

And that is the sad, sorry tale of the "land of the free and the home of the brave".

I usually follow the mindset of "Blocking is for pussies."

I have followed that mindset my entire life. Reddit, facebook, every social media I have ever used, games, whatever.

Reddit, unironically, has so many bots, trolls, bad actors, political\-based accounts that I have had to start blocking people on this site. I have blocked like... 100 people in the last week. 

Check account, 11 years old, 60 'contributions', all in the last week and in political shit? Bot or troll, block. 

Check account, 1 week old, immediately bringing up politics out of nowhere, or insulting people for no reason, blocked.

Check account, 3 month old account 3000 contributions, all politics, hostile and abrasive even to those they are agreeing with, blocked.

It's a fucking nightmare.

Well you have a history of posting edited comic panels where you insert an israel flag.

You made multiple posts on Punisher sub, marvelcirclejerk, dccomicscirclejerk and god knows how many other places. You post this panel with an edited israel flag behind Punisher on The Wall. Trying to imply that the Pedophiles Frank kills in this scene were Israeli.

[\<image\>](https://preview.redd.it/6ivup4oi1ofg1.jpeg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd0a7e2a7f19a22173ceb41bd3356aa89b16b5c4)

I'm not against Israel hate but altering comic panels to fit your agenda is stupid.

I'm not surprised you got banned. The ICE fan art was already posted on the subreddit before you posted it.

I guess low effort Reposts was the last straw.

Post Title:      The tendency to feel like a perpetual victim is strongly tied to vulnerable narcissism. Individuals who frequently perceive themselves as victims and signal this status to others often possess high levels of vulnerable narcissism and emotional instability.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I feel like this issue is difficult to talk about because it's such a minefield of people who were genuine victims and were either accused of being abusers or accused of making it up. 

Just like there are abusers who accuse victims of making it up, there are people, often abusers themselves that will lie about being victims. The problem with many of these allegations is they're not provable in either direction making it impossible to tell the victim apart from the abuser.

And people are victims of bamboozle on massive scales by very gifted and talented clergy storytelling and presentation.

I'm honestly sick of celebrities. And I'm sick of Americans caring about every little thing they say or do. They are people, that's it. They are not better or more important then you. Smarter than you. Or better people than you. These people sit in their mansions, protected from the world. They know nothing about the real world. These posts are so self serving, feeding only their ego, vs affecting real change. They live in a world where the people they associate with, are the people who, responsible for this. I don't see Billie Eilish standing on the front lines in Minnesota. I see Renee Good. I see Alex Pretti. The people who make this country work and who always have are working class people. Real Americans. Not celebrities. They are takers.

1. This is textbook virtue signalling down to the exact definition
2. No one should be relying on celebrities to help form an opinion. In fact, if you even care what a celebrity's opinion is on something unrelated to their craft, you are very far gone.

This is what I don’t get… the “right” likes to ask the question “do you want a man going into the bathroom with your daughter? What if they attack her?” If that happened my anger would be at sexual predators, not trans\-people. It’s crazy to me that the “right” has a higher tolerance for sexual predators than trans\-people just trying to live their lives. They knowingly elected one to be president.

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.
