Native English speakers, does "concrete interests" make sense to you? As in does it mean "well\-defined, purposeful interests"? Russian is my first language and I've only ever heard this expression in Russian and it feels like they just translated it directly

My theory is that China will, within the next 5 years, develop their own chips on par with Taiwan and flood the market, making Taiwan irrelevant to the west, all the while building up its military. By then China will make its move on Taiwan, not because they need the chips, but because the west won't need it so much and it won't be worth defending. China has gained the most in everything that's happening.

Leftists are the priority. As Trump would say "*the radical left lunatics*".

Eradicate them. Assimilate them. Or have them move.

He's already said the "threat" is from within. He's already taking action against left\-leaning states.

It's not like it's a hidden agenda!

It's exactly what China did. Too poor to rise up. Anyone against it moved to Taiwan or elsewhere or just put up with it (were "disappeared" otherwise).

I hope Russia will withdraw from this organization.

And the citizens of my country pay for all of this, not to mention the fact that this organization is corrupt from top to bottom.

Lemmy is crap. I moved there for 2\-3 weeks when the reddit app scandal was booming.
In my view reddit is left\-right wing with a tendency to the right. Lemmy is hard left, say anything remotely close to the center and you are out. It’s worse than reddit, at least here you get both sides.

> Block-happy, deport-happy, self-deport intimidation. The bigger trouble is there is no morality education. Banning is the moral teacher, which teaches only the power of machines and power itself. No education or teaching of WHY. And hence, without morality learning, people on Reddit community do not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 in the face of MAGA cult. People just chant word "cult" and do not see any moral need / civic duty, for *Adult education** with nonfiction serious books and peer to peer teaching.

My account received a warning for threatening people with violence because I said a lot of people would not survive a conflict between the USA and Europe. I appealed because I strongly disagreed, I did not threaten anyone and I just said the obvious, but the warning remained in place.

Reddit is VERY biased and I wouldn't be surprised if they go after pro European subreddits. At first I didn't even comprehend the warning because I didn't understand what they were talking about. But now it's making more sense.

I was banned permanently from an airplane subreddit for commenting “pedo force 1” under a photo of the Orange Buffoon’s airplane depicted in CH. 

Bottom line is that the platform is teeming with fascist enablers and they will quickly use any semblance of motivation to go ahead and silence anyone that dares call out the criminal behavior of Trump and his cronies.

Be careful where you post cause they’re also brigading reports and the likes. The supposedly “pro free speech” crowd is actually all in with censorship when it fits their interest.

I had a comment removed because it 'contains a banned URL,' so here's my third attempt that is completely scrubbed of any full website names, because apparently you aren't supposed to talk about them. I didn't know! Hopefully this comment passes the algorithm. 

Just start using this site based in Poland called Wykop or something. you can reconstruct the rest of the web address by adding the .pl extension yourself. Yes, there's not a lot of english on the site right now, but the site is a "reddit\-like" and has been around for years. It's based entirely in the EU. 

I'm still on the original version of reddit with the Reddit Enhancement Suite browser extension, but with browser extensions or thrid party apps \- like the type that reddit banned back in 2023 \- you can make wykop look pretty much however you want. There's already a European version of reddit, the hard part is already done.

Maybe some of those apps that were banned could just be modified to use wykop's api instead of reddit's. It might actually be a very easy transition. 

Reddit *used to* be a small, open\-source website, and as a result there were reddit clones in different parts of the world. The only ones I ever paid much attention to were wykop and pikabu, but I'm obviously not going to advocate for a Russian site at this point. But the code to host an instance of reddit itself used to be publicly available, it might just be out there on somebody's hard drive somewhere.

Reddit spent *a billion dollars* on the redesign, which I think looks like garbage, but it also meant that the site started having tremendous pressures to monetize the content, and it's been going downhill ever since. If a Euroreddit ever takes off, I'll be there too... but for everybody's sake: please stay a small and unambitious company

Yes reddit is very much pro fascism ... When it comes to people defending themselves, reddit has an extremely loose definition of "incitement to violence".

> Reddit is a Trump image fandom.Media fans of Trump as entertainment source. Mimicking Trump, adopting his words and techniques of communications. People follow the Trump image signals. Trump leads with hate and Reddit is a hate-prizing anti-Malala anti-MLKJr society. People quote Trump constantly but avoid any kind of messages about the need for more love, compassion, world peace. Those are all mocked like Trump mocks compassion and peace for out-groups.
> 
> If Reddit society cared about the future of USA (goodness), adult education of morality and goodness would be constant top topics. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 is almost entirely ignored on Reddit. People far prefer saying little tiny-short messages of anti-education. Little 4-word "cult 45" jokes. Which is a cult of mocking. Trump leads thousands of different cults of mockery. Like 25,000 Trump subreddits and TV channels all of winch mock and insult. All Trump techniques, all the time.

> The whole game of mocking is a corrupt sport. But all people car about is being on a specific team of mocking other teams of mockery. Surkov won. The technique won. Mocking and hate are prized all across the USA in year 2026. It was not this way before year 2013, hate wasn't prized and promoted everywhere. MLK Jr's hate education and understandings have been erased from concern by Putin's Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency since march 2013.

Every country should boycott! We're not fit for the world stage. Last time we hosted in '94 our country was a mess, but this is way different. The orange oligarch has everything so fucked up.

MAGA understands how much people hate them. The perception of being hated is a big driver behind MAGA and similar sorts of reactionary populist movements. 

"Hey MAGA, we all hate you!" isn't an own, it's, in their minds, a reaffirmation of the fear that motivates undemocratic efforts to make sure the people who hate them don't have the chance to return to power.

Don't pin it all on Trump. It's also the Senate, Congress, the 77 million people who voted for him and the 90 million people who couldn't be bothered to get off their couch to vote against him. And for the second time as well. America has shown its true colours and they aren't pretty.

American conservativism \- in it's current state \- is an absolute cancer.

It's also tragic how many Americans consider themselves 'centrists' because they think they're 'half\-way' between Trump and Biden.

Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

Yeah liberal Americans like to believe that these hateful fucks don't walk among us. But half of this country approves of this shit. They absolutely travel abroad and they do so with a feeling of moral superiority. You're more likely to encounter liberal Americans abroad because they are more sociable but that doesn't mean right wingers aren't hanging around.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
From the article:

Robert Fico was concerned about the U.S. president’s “psychological state,” two of the diplomats said. Fico used the word “dangerous” to describe how the U.S. president came across during their face\-to\-face meeting at Trump’s Mar\-a\-Lago estate in Florida on Jan. 17, according to two of the diplomats.

Fico seemed to be “traumatized” by his encounter with Trump, one of the European diplomats said. Fico characterized Trump as being “out of his mind“.

Fears about the U.S. president’s health are “rapidly becoming a more conversed topic at all levels,” said an EU official.

Should we start to get worried?

More and more people are slowly realizing the reality of what happened in 2024 when Americans elected a convicted criminal who promised to rule as a dictator.

Mocking away, insulting, name-calling, following the hate leadership. MLK Jr's teachings about hate have been entirely erased by Russia's Internet Research Agency. People are entirely avoidant of asserting equality of humans (USA Deceleration of independence ideals). The cheering on of "Leopards At My Face" movement is a pro-suffering pro-hate pro-terrorist media cult. People do not want to turn to nonfiction from Dr. Bandy X Lee to focus on mental health and learn from mistakes an get on better mindsets. Instead, people follow Trump's leadership of mockery and hate. Trump leads with hate, the tech loving communities follow.

obvious insider trading scheme is obvious

ignoring the fact that airlines are huge and completely derailing their regional operations would probably lead to them lobbying a lot of politicians to get rid of Trump

also ignoring the fact that I'm pretty sure Trump doesn't have the authority for this

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
My personal thesis all along has been that Epstein was a honeypot being run by either Israel or Russia. Would explain where all the money came from out of nowhere. Would help explain how/why this was all kept under wraps for as long as it was. Would help explain the extreme efforts to bury it. Would add yet another capable player to the “if he didn’t kill himself, who could have been capable?” list (once Epstein is in jail, he’s a liability rather than an asset for the intelligence org operating him).

No shit. I’m losing my mind how no one is realizing the obvious. Maxwell, her sister, and father are all Mossad / IDF.

> ANSWER: Follow the leadership of Malala, go back to her year 2013 speeches and books and start sharing and quoting Malala. STAND UP with your voice and say: **I agree with Malala year 2013!** "Why should I wait for someone else!" https://youtu.be/gjGL6YY6oMs?t=195 "Why don't WE speak up for our rights!" "started writing diary" - like Anne Fucking Frank!
