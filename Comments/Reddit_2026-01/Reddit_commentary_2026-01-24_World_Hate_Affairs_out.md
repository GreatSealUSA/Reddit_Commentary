Native English speakers, does "concrete interests" make sense to you? As in does it mean "well\-defined, purposeful interests"? Russian is my first language and I've only ever heard this expression in Russian and it feels like they just translated it directly

My theory is that China will, within the next 5 years, develop their own chips on par with Taiwan and flood the market, making Taiwan irrelevant to the west, all the while building up its military. By then China will make its move on Taiwan, not because they need the chips, but because the west won't need it so much and it won't be worth defending. China has gained the most in everything that's happening.

Leftists are the priority. As Trump would say "*the radical left lunatics*".

Eradicate them. Assimilate them. Or have them move.

He's already said the "threat" is from within. He's already taking action against left\-leaning states.

It's not like it's a hidden agenda!

It's exactly what China did. Too poor to rise up. Anyone against it moved to Taiwan or elsewhere or just put up with it (were "disappeared" otherwise).

Lemmy is crap. I moved there for 2\-3 weeks when the reddit app scandal was booming.
In my view reddit is left\-right wing with a tendency to the right. Lemmy is hard left, say anything remotely close to the center and you are out. It’s worse than reddit, at least here you get both sides.

Reddit is one of the least free speech forums on the Internet. You can be banned for anything.


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> Block-happy, deport-happy, self-deport intimidation. The bigger trouble is there is no morality education. Banning is the moral teacher, which teaches only the power of machines and power itself. No education or teaching of WHY. And hence, without morality learning, people on Reddit community do not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 in the face of MAGA cult. People just chant word "cult" and do not see any moral need / civic duty, for *Adult education** with nonfiction serious books and peer to peer teaching.

My account received a warning for threatening people with violence because I said a lot of people would not survive a conflict between the USA and Europe. I appealed because I strongly disagreed, I did not threaten anyone and I just said the obvious, but the warning remained in place.

Reddit is VERY biased and I wouldn't be surprised if they go after pro European subreddits. At first I didn't even comprehend the warning because I didn't understand what they were talking about. But now it's making more sense.

I was banned permanently from an airplane subreddit for commenting “pedo force 1” under a photo of the Orange Buffoon’s airplane depicted in CH. 

Bottom line is that the platform is teeming with fascist enablers and they will quickly use any semblance of motivation to go ahead and silence anyone that dares call out the criminal behavior of Trump and his cronies.

Be careful where you post cause they’re also brigading reports and the likes. The supposedly “pro free speech” crowd is actually all in with censorship when it fits their interest.

I had a comment removed because it 'contains a banned URL,' so here's my third attempt that is completely scrubbed of any full website names, because apparently you aren't supposed to talk about them. I didn't know! Hopefully this comment passes the algorithm. 

Just start using this site based in Poland called Wykop or something. you can reconstruct the rest of the web address by adding the .pl extension yourself. Yes, there's not a lot of english on the site right now, but the site is a "reddit\-like" and has been around for years. It's based entirely in the EU. 

I'm still on the original version of reddit with the Reddit Enhancement Suite browser extension, but with browser extensions or thrid party apps \- like the type that reddit banned back in 2023 \- you can make wykop look pretty much however you want. There's already a European version of reddit, the hard part is already done.

Maybe some of those apps that were banned could just be modified to use wykop's api instead of reddit's. It might actually be a very easy transition. 

Reddit *used to* be a small, open\-source website, and as a result there were reddit clones in different parts of the world. The only ones I ever paid much attention to were wykop and pikabu, but I'm obviously not going to advocate for a Russian site at this point. But the code to host an instance of reddit itself used to be publicly available, it might just be out there on somebody's hard drive somewhere.

Reddit spent *a billion dollars* on the redesign, which I think looks like garbage, but it also meant that the site started having tremendous pressures to monetize the content, and it's been going downhill ever since. If a Euroreddit ever takes off, I'll be there too... but for everybody's sake: please stay a small and unambitious company

Yes reddit is very much pro fascism ... When it comes to people defending themselves, reddit has an extremely loose definition of "incitement to violence".

But when it comes to the perpetrator, it seems to be free for all

> Reddit is a Trump image fandom.Media fans of Trump as entertainment source. Mimicking Trump, adopting his words and techniques of communications. People follow the Trump image signals. Trump leads with hate and Reddit is a hate-prizing anti-Malala anti-MLKJr society. People quote Trump constantly but avoid any kind of messages about the need for more love, compassion, world peace. Those are all mocked like Trump mocks compassion and peace for out-groups.
> 
> If Reddit society cared about the future of USA (goodness), adult education of morality and goodness would be constant top topics. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 is almost entirely ignored on Reddit. People far prefer saying little tiny-short messages of anti-education. Little 4-word "cult 45" jokes. Which is a cult of mocking. Trump leads thousands of different cults of mockery. Like 25,000 Trump subreddits and TV channels all of winch mock and insult. All Trump techniques, all the time.
> 
> The whole game of mocking is a corrupt sport. But all people car about is being on a specific team of mocking other teams of mockery. Surkov won. The technique won. Mocking and hate are prized all across the USA in year 2026. It was not this way before year 2013, hate wasn't prized and promoted everywhere. MLK Jr's hate education and understandings have been erased from concern by Putin's Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency since march 2013. Again: Surkov won. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4

Every country should boycott! We're not fit for the world stage. Last time we hosted in '94 our country was a mess, but this is way different. The orange oligarch has everything so fucked up.

Imagine coming here to play soccer and end up being abducted by an ice agent because you can't prove that you're allowed to be here.

MAGA understands how much people hate them. The perception of being hated is a big driver behind MAGA and similar sorts of reactionary populist movements. 

"Hey MAGA, we all hate you!" isn't an own, it's, in their minds, a reaffirmation of the fear that motivates undemocratic efforts to make sure the people who hate them don't have the chance to return to power.

Don't pin it all on Trump. It's also the Senate, Congress, the 77 million people who voted for him and the 90 million people who couldn't be bothered to get off their couch to vote against him. And for the second time as well. America has shown its true colours and they aren't pretty.

American conservativism \- in it's current state \- is an absolute cancer.

It's also tragic how many Americans consider themselves 'centrists' because they think they're 'half\-way' between Trump and Biden.

Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

Yeah liberal Americans like to believe that these hateful fucks don't walk among us. But half of this country approves of this shit. They absolutely travel abroad and they do so with a feeling of moral superiority. You're more likely to encounter liberal Americans abroad because they are more sociable but that doesn't mean right wingers aren't hanging around.

From the article:

Robert Fico was concerned about the U.S. president’s “psychological state,” two of the diplomats said. Fico used the word “dangerous” to describe how the U.S. president came across during their face\-to\-face meeting at Trump’s Mar\-a\-Lago estate in Florida on Jan. 17, according to two of the diplomats.

Fico seemed to be “traumatized” by his encounter with Trump, one of the European diplomats said. Fico characterized Trump as being “out of his mind“.

Fears about the U.S. president’s health are “rapidly becoming a more conversed topic at all levels,” said an EU official.

Should we start to get worried?

More and more people are slowly realizing the reality of what happened in 2024 when Americans elected a convicted criminal who promised to rule as a dictator.

People are entirely avoidant of asserting equality of humans (USA Deceleration of independence ideals). The cheering on of "Leopards At My Face" movement is a pro-suffering pro-hate pro-terrorist media cult. People do not want to turn to nonfiction from Dr. Bandy X Lee to focus on mental health and learn from mistakes an get on better mindsets.

obvious insider trading scheme is obvious

ignoring the fact that airlines are huge and completely derailing their regional operations would probably lead to them lobbying a lot of politicians to get rid of Trump

also ignoring the fact that I'm pretty sure Trump doesn't have the authority for this

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
My personal thesis all along has been that Epstein was a honeypot being run by either Israel or Russia. Would explain where all the money came from out of nowhere. Would help explain how/why this was all kept under wraps for as long as it was. Would help explain the extreme efforts to bury it. Would add yet another capable player to the “if he didn’t kill himself, who could have been capable?” list (once Epstein is in jail, he’s a liability rather than an asset for the intelligence org operating him).

No shit. I’m losing my mind how no one is realizing the obvious. Maxwell, her sister, and father are all Mossad / IDF. 

Epstein wasn’t a mastermind. He was being run by Maxwell.

There was a giant pedophile island that was created specifically for the elite, wealthy and untouchable. Out of the whole thing, the traffickers, the johns, the girls, the pilots, the ship captains, the organizers, the ones that held open the damn doors. We managed to arrest 2 and 1 is in jail.. low level prostitution rings have seen 30\+ arrested.. we can only get 2? Out of all the names, accusations, photos and videos, only 2?!

People who are not serious about turning the topic to young girls and Malala's reformations... but just want to promote simple-thinking ideas and avoidance of Malala's nonfiction education, teaching, learning, comprehension, understanding focus. Twitter-thinking is about avoidance of deeper understanding and attraction to high-speed "rush" of notification delivery.

Wait, is this, directed at, democrats? A distinct and shameless lack of empathy has literally been the primary underlying characteristic of the GOP for a decade now. In fact, it’s the GOP has pretty transparently weaponized those words against democrats. There was literally an aggressive anti\-DEI campaign carried out on the orders of Trump, and such consistent anti\-woke and anti\-DEI rhetoric that many MAGA republicans genuinely think most black \& brown professionals are underqualified compared to their white counterparts.

I get why some people want to think it's all one idiots doing, but no one can single\-handedly control an entire country. Trump has only been able to do any damage because a huge chunk of the population was willing to give him that power, an entire political party is willing to support and defend everything he does, the majority of the media are willing to give up journalistic integrity for access, the majority of the Supreme Court are willing to publicly be hypocrites to rubber stamp anything he wants and so many more things.

What's really interesting is that a) she had the resources to take on The Sun and win, even Prince Harry is struggling to do that and b) aside from her win over The Sun, and recent speculation about her after this release, she's fucking memory holed on search engines.

Which means she had the money to pay search deoptimization experts, as well as the money to, once again, smash the goddamned *Sun* newspaper.

So, we can assume she's British, so she's either...

1\) Old aristocratic money
2\) Married into money, old or new
3\) Entirely self\-made.

But given she is described as an "interior designer" in the court documents from the Sun case, we can probably assume \#3 isn't a candidate.

Yep he is compromised by RUS SIA and IS RAEL. Both countries can make him do whatever they want or need.From suspending help to Ukraine and blaming them for not ending a war by surrending to the invader to also allow and help geno cide GA ZA and bomb a country like I RAN that is so far away from the US. 
Taco is sucessfully destroying USA, the most powerfull country in the world from inside. Quite impressive. I hope americans are able to stop him and in the future make a system of checks and balances stronger than before and wipe the ones in power getting funded by foreign countries because only then USA will be truly free.

This is all Israel and Russias long term plan. Get the richest, most influential people on the planet in highly immoral, compromising position so they can do whatever the fuck they want. 
The fact the “leader of the free world” is named as a serial visitor to the island and hasn’t been removed from his position shows the state of corruption in the world. What does HE have on others? 
I’m saddened by the things that have occurred, but I’m also pleased it’s starting to come out. It’s the worst kept secret for many years and finally some form of justice will happen.

Donald J Trump is one of the biggest pedophiles in American history. There is video evidence which Epstein had, which Israel has, and Russia has. 
The decisions our president makes for all of us is predicated on the prevention of those tapes being leaked. Impeach him immediately.

If he was compromised. There no way Russia wouldn’t have released it by now. They put a shit ton of secondary sanctions on anyone who buys Russian oil which isn’t something you would see from someone who is compromised

Maybe don't have the US president casually mention he could order all US military tech to be shut down remotely (I think he mentioned it first in his presidency) and have Microsoft admit they could disable all their tech in Europe....... (recently)

Then again, we do live in the age of the Reverse Midas touched Orange.

Now that the unspoken taboo has been spoken out loud, naturally most nation blocks will try and disconnect themselves for their own good and protection. Makes logical sense. Trump did what Trump does best, ruin businesses. Europe will decouple and never come back until fascism is dealt with in the US.

Edit for clarification: I genuinely doubt that Europe will blindly embrace US tech anytime soon again. We are moving more and more into European alternatives and that will become entrenched. The economic concept of "first mover" in tech will die out now that we have had tech reliance for too long and shown the dangers of it.

You know, Ukraine probably could have actually won its war if all the money/weapons/ammunition that were sent to Israel over the course of the past 3 years were automatically sent to Ukraine instead.

What did Schumer do that Israel knows and we don’t? That should be the question everyone is asking themselves here. Why are our politicians so deeply devoted to Israel? What dirt does the Israeli government have on these people that they’re openly defying the will of their constituents?

Now do a report on his lengthy and well documented ties to Israel

Here is a 2 hour deep dive with FriendlyJordies an independent journalist with an actual spine who’s survived attempts on his life over his reporting on corruption and refusal to leave the families that run organized crime in NSW alone to the point they firebombed his house

It is crazy to watch this entire thread get brigaded by bots trying to redirect the conversation to Israel. Putin is mentioned 1,000 times in the emails. Moscow is mentioned 10,000 times. Epstein was literally helping every far right party in europe get funding from Russia. 

The same Russian intelligence apparatus in this thread trying to redirect every conversation away from Russia.

Edit: the brigading by anti Israel folks is hilarious. Yes Jeffery Epstein was connected to Israeli intelligence. Yes that’s very bad. You can criticize two things without making your entire life around deflecting Russian blame for this.

It’s odd that being in the Epstein files would have such a hold over anybody.

I obviously can’t speak for psychopathic rapists, but…

If I knew I was implicated in something, I’d probably just fess up, take the charge, and live in jail for the rest of my life.

I don’t see why it’s such a big deal to just own up to what you did.

But of course, I am just a normal, non\-narcissistic person talking.

Post Title:      Karen Mulder tried to warn everyone about similar Epstein rings and no one listened.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Y'all should read about Natacha Jaitt. She was also a model and actress who blew the whistle on a pedophile ring in a soccer club in Argentina, where basically the men in power would rape and prostitute the kids that had hopes of becoming pro players one day, many times with the knowledge of their parents.

Natacha said she knew her life was now in danger, very publicly denounced that she was NOT intended on committing suicide, said she'd been sober and clear from drugs for a long time, and that she would NOT be overdosing. She said, and I quote, "when you find my body, remember it was not me, I didn't commit suicide, I didn't OD."

Guess how they found her body.

And ever since, I haven't really seen anyone talking about the scandal.

Edited to add: this was way more recent, btw. Natacha was murdered in 2019\.

Post Title:      Karen Mulder tried to warn everyone about similar Epstein rings and no one listened.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
On 31 October 2001, 90s supermodel Karen Mulder was interviewed on a France show in front of a live studio audience. During the show's taping, Mulder claimed that various people had raped her, including police officers, politicians, members of her former agency Elite Model Management, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco.

The producers of the show did not broadcast the interview, and the recording was erased. Her parents blamed her troubles on drugs.

Days later, Mulder repeated her allegations, this time to a weekly magazine in an interview conducted in her Paris apartment. Within hours of the interview, her sister Saskia arrived and took her to Villa Montsouris, a psychiatric hospital specializing in such disorders as depression, anxiety, and delirium, where she stayed for five months. The stay reportedly was paid for by Elite models president Gérald Marie, her employer and one of the accused.

It came after the BBC caught Marie on hidden camera trying to give a 15\-year\-old model £300 for sex, and bragging about Elite Model Look competitors he would sleep with that year.

> * "They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy. Now, **today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression?** This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and our **own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**." - 1988 book, "Power of Myth"

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I don't know where else to post it, but right now TikTok has started hiding specific videos only from the American users. 

[https://i.imgur.com/MEhdCS1\.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/MEhdCS1.jpeg)

This is a famous Italian parody channel that makes videos regarding a lot of completely different topics, including a video about the recent you know which specific American special military corp and the Olympics situation.

At some point, one of his American followers took contact with him asking why he decided to remove the video, but the point is that... the owner of the TikTok channel never did it. The video has been silently hidden only from the American users without any kind of notification. The owner would've never noticed it if it wasn't for that follower.

As you already know, since 22 January 2026, American companies own 80% of the platform, which means that they can decide on their own how to control the platform just like Musk can manage X. 

This was a funny and harmless video, but it really makes you wonder how many videos have been hidden so far. Are we really going to the same direction of China that is currently hiding news, pictures and videos containing specific words?

That’s very old fashioned, we all have lived with advertising for years.

The current McDonalds ads that kind of tell a part of your life story in like a two and a half minute ad. It’s like from when you get married and when you have your grandkids until you die. You get that two and a half minutes and then there is a McDonalds thing, like “Good; I was born, I had kids, I died, and in the meantime I got a Big Mac”. I mean this is sort of “Gone With the Wind” condensed into a short version. **It’s fast, it’s hyperreal,** and in the meantime you at least got a Big Mac. You know, you never will have to be hungry again, you know, reproduced to infinity over and over on videotape. Change the Laserdisc, you can watch Scarlett O’Hara. I said that a million times, if we had the technology right now to do it we could just have Scarlett back there screaming about terror while I am doing this. In any case, ah, **if Baudrillard is even onto something**, what the postmodern trajectory means is that the self is not under siege, it’s lost. It’s just lost. And if that’s true then all of the strategies by which ordinary people try to live decent good lives are lost along with it. I am not necessarily going to buy that right away, I am really not. I do think that **the new, ah, technologies are going to call forth**… I mean this is why the title of this course has been “The Self Under Siege”. If I didn’t think it was a real, virulent technological siege and just some thought up philosopher’s dream, which would not have interested me.

Bill gates reputation throughout his year.

A cold, heartless, brutal business ass who crush smaller firms to make billions.

A reforming philanthropist spending billions in Africa, solving or helping big issues, plan to donating billions more.

Now a sex fiend, a predator

Bill Gates is a legendary Poon Hound. He has sent inappropriate messages to his female colleagues and had a lot of affairs. His wife was very disturbed about his friendship with Ebstein

News: allegedly guilty man who is allegedly mentioned 2,000\+ times in Epstein files and has allegedly had multiple Microsoft former employees come out and allegedly say he had sex with them (while he was married), claims he is innocent.

IMO, bro is not a kiddie fucker. I don’t think he fucked kids. But I do think he used his position of power to have sex with employees and also had sex with prostitutes who were part of human trafficking.

History should not look kindly on bill gates. He has zero remorse and zero intention of admitting fault.

BUT, DONT LET THIS DISTRACT YOU THAT TRUMP IS ALLEGEDLY MENTIONED 38,000 TIMES. RELEASE THE FILES

I mean if Epstein said it in an email sent to \<checks notes\> Epstein, it must be true.

After all Epstein claims, in a spelling error\-laced draft, that Bill Gates wrote him an email about it!

Weird how *that* email doesn't seem to actually exist.

She admits his relationship with Epstein was a factor in the divorce. Is there anything in the files that suggests he is a pedo? Obviously being close to Epstein makes that a real possibility, but I thought his name came up regarding getting a STD from a Russian prostitute? 

Epstein had thousands of business relationships with a huge range of debauchery (from clean to rape/murder). I didn't think it's entirely clear where Gates was on that spectrum.

Natalie Portman defended Polanski. My beloved David Lynch did too. The amount of Hollywood people that signed the petition to exonerate the guy would surprise you.

I just think that Hollywood people live in a whole different reality. Much like musicians, they are used to star struck infantile fans wanting to be with them, so they see it as normal. Musicians get away with this shit much more than actors, so many musicians even wrote on their autobiographies about hooking up with minors and nobody gives a damn because they make music.

Fuck celebrity culture.

Conservatives doing damage control so that the majority of Canadians don't see the party as a bunch of traitors, but also doing it an way that doesn't require *current* members to say anything that would alienate their Trumper wannabe base.

He's running damage control for the Conservatives, with a secondary goal of suggesting a rationale for more right\-wing, pro\-corporate, anti\-environment policies.

Note he didn't detail exactly what sort of sacrifices he thinks should be made. That's a nicely vague concept for later justifying *anything*, and for claiming any new idea the Conservatives start pushing is a 'necessary sacrifice'. 

For example:

* Pipelines through first nations lands without consultation
* loosening the Canada Health Act to let provinces (like Alberta) privatise health care
* opening up public land to more development and mining
* subsidising oil companies to preserve 'access to strategic resources'

Etc.

I feel the U.S. has been subverted by foreign(RSSA) and domestic(billionaires, far right) adversaries to the Constitution. This has been decades in the making with constant divisive propaganda, demoralization, and now rapid destabilization of its alliances, institutions, and economy. All democracies should safeguard against this with truth, justice, and unity.

Americans must unite to defend their Constitution, uphold the rule of law, and defend free elections. It's imperative to world stability.

This has been clear to Canadians since Trump's first threats in 2024 to annex our country. US foreign policy has now extended to owning or controlling Greenland, Canada, Cuba, Venezuela and possibly Mexico. American values and specific policies are completely changed. It's a positive sign that European countries are making this awareness public.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).

The Kremlin propagandists are currently working full time to cover up Russias involvement on this and score some cheap disruption points at the same time. 

Just today I saw a post on instagram with 100s of thousands of “likes” blatantly lying about how Putin is not mentioned in the files, when he is mentioned hundreds of times, never mind his lackeys which were regularly sending requests to Epstein. Thousands of bot comments underneath talking about how much respect they have for Putin including a fucking ridiculous one about how much Polish people love him, unironically lmao.

At this point I think social media sites need to be regulated somehow, because this shit is insane. Its clearly just a tool of manipulation for billionaires and autocrats and a large reason the world as a whole is regressing.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's another Epstein equivalent out there that just has a better security measures. Elites still have a lot of money and lust for forbidden pleasures.

The article never claims that he was the "human rights commissioner"? 

It says that: 

> Jagland ran the Council of Europe—the continent's human rights watchdog.

---

> Jagland wasn't a fringe figure. He ran the institution that decides whether Russia belongs in European human rights bodies, helped choose Nobel Peace Prize winners, and shaped the debate over sanctions after Crimea.

---

> In 2009, he took the top job at the Council of Europe—the continent's human rights watchdog—and held it for a decade.

Jagland did serve as secretary general of the Council of Europe from 2009 to 2019, and one of the main tasks of the CoE is to uphold human rights in Europe. 

The Commissioner for Human Rights was established by the CoE and exists within the CoE (under their umbrella basically): 

> The Commissioner for Human Rights is an institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights within the member states.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe> 

> The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights is an independent and impartial non\-judicial institution established in 1999 by the Strasbourg\-based Council of Europe, to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the council's 46 member states.

"Under the Surkov media invasion (Russia against NATO), USA social media has become an environment where banalisation is the ultimate outcome of every serious conversation.

This scumbag wants western societies to collapse so he and his buddies can scoop up and control as many failing industries as possible.

Him and Epstein talked in emails in relation to Brexit how it's easier finding things on their way to collapse than trying to find the next bargain.

It's literally in his interests for this to happen and he knows what he's doing with his rants about people trying to stop general societal collapse. 

Him and his sick group of bastards want to undo the last century of progress everywhere, remove total power from civilians.

Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. **It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."

> In lectures on Christianity delivered to select audiences, Thiel has argued the Antichrist in the 21st century will not resemble the stereotypical mad scientist, but rather a self\-described protector who promises peace, safety, and an end to technological risk. Drawing on apocalyptic passages from the Bible, he portrays an approaching choice between a “one‑world state” aligned with the Antichrist and an Armageddon‑style collapse if that project fails, framing both scenarios as live possibilities for contemporary politics and technology.

A billionaire who has advocated for mass surveillance, the taking away of rights, manipulation of the public, and the hoarding of wealth, who has potentially at least been witness to some evil acts, has to convince himself he's still a good person by acting like the advocates who are against his interests are the literal manifestation of evil.

It would almost be tragic if it wasn't so evil in and of itself.

He is obviously mentally unwell or trying to manipulate the death cult christians

> "mentally unwell" from Bible science fiction media ("Anti-Christ" posting context), Reddit cult media people will not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction books. Just Twitter-length commenting messages on Reddit saying "mentally unwell" and nothing to rescue or educate people. "mentally unwell" on Reddit media society is street-gang shit-commenting shit-talk shit-posting language of Reddit shit-prizing to insult and mock out-groups / individuals who don't conform to Reddit hive minded thinking. You won't see people discussing nonfiction books about mental health when they throw out these (Information highway metaphors) street-gang signs and symbols.

It would appear that one the most influential billionaires, who appears to be a driving force around the world with his company, is afraid the end is nigh due to a young woman who cares about the environment we live in and the well being others.

I'm not a christian, but watching a billionaire who constantly talks about how people who protest the powerful are the real anti\-christ, who has ties to an international CSA ring, who has connections in the white house and other world governments, who runs a tech spyware company utlised by many governments named after the device from a Catholic author's fantasy that corrupts the minds of leaders into being unwitting servants of ultimate evil, , . . . Well, it makes one start to believe in the anti\-christ. . . 

And that we're all living in a novel, a badly written one, whatever Garth Marenghi's equivalent to The Stand or the Dead Zone would've been.

This guy is puzzling. For a person with such strong ideological convictions and political power, he can't even explain his own views. Not defend, just explain.

If I were to summarize his point, he's saying that because of environmental activists and other people campaigning for regulations, the world is heating towards an apocalyptic scale catastrophe.

That is all out nuclear war... wait no. It's famines and scarcity of resources so sever a big part of the world population will die... not this one either. It's a pandemic ten times worse than COVID... nope.

None of that. The catastrophic end of times event is... technological and scientific progress slows down. What!? We're not even using the current technological knowledge anything close to it's full potential due to trade wars, literal wars, economic inequality, lack of adequate education, etc. and you want me to feel bad about technology that doesn't even exist? None of this makes sense.

Gonna remind everyone in the chat that Peter Thiel named his *military surveillance company* after a magic seeing stone that Sauron used to spy on his enemies, feed them false information, and drive them into depression and dispair so they didn't fight back when he sent orcs after them. And the 21 year old who rides boats to fight climate change is supposed to be the antichrist. Riiiight.

This is the same tune he’s been singing for *years*

By itself it’s not a problem. But…this is the guy who hand\-picked and sponsored VD Vance. He has huge influence over the current administration

I’d go as far as to say that he’s the reason why Trump dying or otherwise being incapacitated would be worse than it currently is \- same influence from the same people with the same agendas, but with someone who’s got a brain and is happy to bend the knee, as opposed to someone who has to be managed like a toddler

Where Greta fights tooth and nail for the betterment of humanity through environmentalism and equality, Thiel the billionaire likens her to Antichrist?

As Jesus taught: “what you did not do for the least of these, you did not do for me”. If his teachings matter in an analysis of what constitutes the antichrist, Thiel’s statements and actions seem at odds with those of Greta and Jesus himself.

I’m pretty sure if the antichrist and apocalypse is coming, it’s going to have something to do with the BILLIONAIRE CHILD PREDATORS WHO ARE SECRETLY INFLUENCING WORLD EVENTS AND allegedly SACRIFICING CHILDREN. people allegedly like Peter Thiel

His creepy obsession with her is very concerning. Also, every single person obsessed with the anti Christ is comic book villain levels of evil. Isn't this prick a paedophile and didn't he literally buy JD Vance's way into the vice presidency so he can be the defacto leader of the US when Trump finally soils his last nappy?

Yup. A young woman who became famous just because she wanted us to focus on fixing our environment. 

Hate her now, fine \- don’t care.

And Peter Theil is an Epstein associate, accellerationist and has regularly boasted that he is actively trying to destroy Western democracy

I don't believe in the Antichrist or any cult followings, but let's pretend the Antichrist is real. I dunno, call me crazy but I'd bet he'd be associated with the worlds biggest pedophile ring leader or be the leader of it himself. He'd probably be a power hungry mad man who does any and everything he wants and never face consequences. That's just my take though.

Yeah, they're going hard into disinformation, trying to connect Mamdani and all sorts of progressive folks to Epstein when it isn't factually true.

(I think this was always their goal with the AI push, by the way\- to further distort reality and pass on misinformation to support their shitty causes.)

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
At first I thought wow Tony Hawk renewed his vows a lot, cute. Then I googled and saw that he in fact did not. Then I saw the photos of his wives and I'm sorry but they look like the same person. What a rollercoaster!

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
12 years before Donald Trump entered the Republican primary in 2015, Republicans started a conspiracy theory that Obama wasn't born in the US and demanded his birth certificate. When he provided it and the Hawaii Department of Health confirmed its authenticity, they made up reasons why it was fake.

You're dealing with a third of the United States that already know what they want to believe or not believe about any given sentence before they've even finished reading it.

By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be repeating it every 47 hours over and over, keep repeating, again and again!

Anyone who cares already doesn't like Musk and billionaires.

A depressingly large percentage of the population has no issues with grown men raping 13\-14 year old girls. 

That's the main takeaway I've gotten from this.

Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

The problem the UK has with this is the first past the post electoral system. You only need about 30% of the popular vote to get a super majority in parliament, so as long as around \~30% of the voting population strongly opposes rejoining (like Reform voters do), it’s essentially political suicide to push for rejoining. Nevermind that the majority would actually support such a move.

Post Title:      Mayor of London: My ultimate goal is to reverse Brexit  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
This won’t happen. 
The USA might not say it publicly but they will do anything to keep the uk out of the eu at this point. 

So will the new British far right. Remember who is leading them right now? The same guy that led brexit.

Like climate change, we knew this 30 years ago but went into psychological denial over it.

Now, 30% of us literally cannot know this. It is beyond their mental ability to know it.

> ANSWER, UNDERSTANDING: Because we put all our most gifted and talented people into commercial art designed to exploit human minds into over-consumption. Billionaires fund advertising, marketing, public relations, sponsorship to program mindsets. We, as a species, have turned religion indoctrination into consumerism indoctrination. We are far too good at exploiting minds with lies and manipulation as a species. We hear of terrible parenting, abusive parents, we hear of Ukraine war, we hear of divorces and child custody battles... but we can't see that we don't educate or teach compassion and marriage itself (families) in our schools. We don't share notes, we keep family secrets and sex secrets and abuse secrets and we elect abusers to the highest power. Because they fund money to pay for art work and symbols to manipulate our subconscious family sex secrets, etc.

Headline should say stabbed by husband. Even though I know women are most likely harmed by their spouses, over any other sources of violence; my mind jumped to politically motivated violence.

I agree with you 100%

> Parents say stuff like this in words, then support age 18 military and don't use social media (measurable) to promote world peace. In fact, parents measurably promote mocking and joking about world pace. People have leaders like Putin and Trump and go on with Super Bowl entertainment and amusements and don't promote major focus on world mental health... such as promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 nonfiction book with 27 people.

We don't seem to study the psychology of war and "fire drills" of what to do when mob mentality groups break out. When hate-driving **cults** break out, there are no mental health fire departments.

If I know anything about money, it's that those who have it hate losing it, and get real ugly when their money is in threat.

Expect some consequences, although I'm not sure if they will be directed at those actually responsible. 

Maybe the financial community can do to the trump regime that which all the others were supposed to.

These are the types of things which countries only begin to consider when a country (which they had considered a strong friend) threatens to invade their allies, and wages a tariff war on them. Expect more of this type of thing as the economies of the EU, Canada, and our Asian allies start to move towards greater self reliance. All of the force multipliers from globalization that US corporations have greatly benefited from, thanks to solid US leadership (in the past), is now a potential liability.

EU finally waking up to the fact that you can't have total dependence on another part of the world for core technology as this can/will be used against you. Should not have taken Russia/Trump to make this obvious.
