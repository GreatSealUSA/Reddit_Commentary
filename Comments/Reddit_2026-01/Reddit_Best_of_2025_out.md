Post Title:      Trump says he has final say on paying himself $230m for past investigations  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
What a bunch of garbage. Donald Trump is a symptom, not the disease. A single person could never be the sole cause and you’re a naive child if you think we live in a time of medieval lords.

The issue will always be capital. As neoliberalism heaves its final breaths, far left and far right sentiment grew in its place. Fearing taxation above all else, capital has made bedfellows with the far right. This is the world we live in. Trump is just dumber and more belligerent than your average far right politician.

It baffles me that in a subreddit like this one we have kindergarten analysis that says, “Hey, don’t blame Republicans! It’s all Trump.” Grow a backbone and stop playing defense for capital\-backed hateful, idiotic, and useful ideologues.

> This Reddit comment:
> 
> 1. Blames Reddit community, the low-effort "kindergarten" level thinking that is prized on Reddit commenting section.
> 
> 2. Calls people "child", adopting MAGA values of name-calling as the supreme communications technique and domination of women and children that Putin / Trump / Musk / Murdoch cultivate.
> 
> 3. Does not in any way consider that extremely poor nations, without capitalism, had slavery to { Torah, Bible, Quran } fiction storytelling of a { Yahweh, Jesus, Allah } in the sky who watches and judges the everyday man into submission.  That the Levant science fiction trilogy spans power of every economic system for thousands of years. Fiction vs. nonfiction storytelling leadership that MAGA is driven by.
> 
> 4. Does not consider Rupert Murdoch media empire as a modern day father-figure in the sky who rules over society like in The Bible and Church. "The Murdoch family’s global media empire, operating through News Corp and Fox Corporation, includes a vast portfolio of news, print, and television venues: Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, The Times (UK), The Sunday Times, The Sun (UK), The Australian, Sky News Australia, Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph (Australia), Courier-Mail, The Advertiser (Adelaide), Barron’s, MarketWatch, Realtor .com, HarperCollins Publishers, and various local community newspapers in Australia and the US." - Google Search summary 2026-01-18 afternoon USA

> 5. Indeed Trump is a symptom indeed! Celebration Of Ignorance. Celebration of Entertainment. Reality TV celebration by We The People. Musk Twitter celebration! Trump is a big time media star who played a "boss man" (fiction *The Apprentice* role) on TV ... that has now taken over the population of minds that vote people into the White House. [NYC Trump, analyze with NYC **NYU Professor Neil Postman's 1985 book** about a second-term POTUS](../Specific/Postman_1985_Howdy_Doody.md).
> 
> 6. Nowhere does this Reddit comment message discuss gender situation and symbolism conflicts / roles around women. The history of MALE ONLY, Father Figure slavery to { Torah, Bible, Quran } fiction storytelling of a { Yahweh, Jesus, Allah }. And how this impacted { Hillary Clinton year 2016, Kamala Harris year 2024, and WIN by male Daddy Joe Biden in 2020 }. And why is woman leader Dr. Bandy X Lee ignored since her October 3, 2017 book was published about Trump and MAGA? Why do you see so many people calling Trump { crazy, insane, lunatic, madman } and not following a GenX leader - Dr. Lee? The book is in ever USA public library, why does nobody on Reddit quote Dr. Lee's writings? Because she is a woman..? Count them: how many messages a day do you see on Reddit calling Trump some variation of "crazy" or "insane" - that DO NOT [mention Dr Bandy X Lee or quote her books](../Bandy_X_Lee)? Regarding Reddit community commenting, see #1 above... on this very list you are now reading.

Lee was born on May 27, 1970, making her approximately 55 years old as of early 2026. Therefore, Kamala Harris is roughly 5 years and 7 months older than Dr. Bandy Lee." - Google Search summary 2026-01-19 afternoon USA

> * One more assertion to add to the women symbolism conflicts: **abortion, birth control**, forced birth, gender in marriages, etc. MAGA movement is generally *not* talking about changing fertility behaviors of men - except maybe to allow adult men to have sex with younger girls; to reduce consent laws from age 16 down to age 12 or age 13. Male domination of women is a huge MAGA social focus.

I think this is important to note. The people out there who are still trying to 'milk' me after 30 years....they're sick. Anyone with a life, with a modicum of the skills necessary to live, would have moved on by now. The most aggressive bullies are usually close to the victims in real status and are either delusional about that, or cynical. Yes, there are psychopaths in the mix, but a large contingent of Chris\-Chan stalkers are probably neurodivergent shut\-ins a lot like her.

Once you've gotten rid of everyone below you on the ladder, the low guy is you. And that's why the 'livestock' concept has arisen\- keep the low man alive, and in pain. As long as you can see them suffering below you, you're not the low man.

> That making fun of bad people isn't funny-washing, LOL-washing and turning crimes and horror acts into a source of entertainment content isn't an actual problem. Ha ha, Donald Trump rapes children, isn't something that sunk an entire nation into hate leadership. That joke-washing and Fox News HDTV comedy-washing LOL-washing that Rupert Murdoch does isn't real harm to the society. That media site owners don't increase their power and influence by selling jokes and comedy like Fox News HDTV does to LOL-wash Trump family. I can be more redundant, yes. But no matter how many ways I rephrase it, people do not grasp or understand Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about Reddit and Fox News in year 1985.

“[What Were You Wearing?](https://dovecenter.org/what-were-you-wearing-exhibit/)”

You seemed to imply that some of these victims of abuse deserved it, due to their own “heinous” or “clownish” behavior.

> The ENTIRE USA, the ENTIRE POPULATION< is a victim of abuse by Rupert Murdoch LOL-cow milking Donald J. Trump for selling of entertainment content Fox News HDTV. I will keep trying to rephrase until my last dying breath. Mob mentality is a real thing. Mafia mentality is Trumpism Fox News. AVOIDING Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction books because everyone is mocking away at Trump on social machines day in and day out since October 3, 2017 publication... mockery in ob mentality to exploit group-thinking mob mentality is a true and real problem.

When every source of information in the world outside your news bubble disagrees with you, the only explanations are that a) you are wrong, or b) there's a global conspiracy against you.

Guess which one it's easier to choose.
