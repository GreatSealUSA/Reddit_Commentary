I keep seeing people say this like somehow there is some genius plan underneath or something. Look the Nazis were also idiots. They flexed incredible competence often towards truly fantastically idiotic aims near constantly. Those around them spent the regime trying to twist the actions into making sense out of shear sense of duty and belief. Like all the facts that have ever come before, it's not about efficiency, it's not about plans, it's not about high ideals, it's about staying in power and gaining more power and that's it. That's the plan. It show strings and bubble gum, wishes and prayers all the way down. It's the competency being wielded for it eroniously that's the challenge not them.

We keep trying to believe that merit is what it takes to rise to the top. It is not. If you see clearly you can realize that, that is the last skill it ever takes to get ahead. And in this case we have the example in point that it is not what it takes to gain power. It doesn't mean they don't have that power. That is a completely separate thing. 

Might does not make right it makes round holes the exceptable path for square blocks. There is no concern for shape. Efficiency doesn't matter. They are hammers and we are nails no matter what fastener we actually are. It's a waste and it will show itself when we are dead as door nails. But the reallity is it's colossally incompetent, colossally wasteful. And there in lies the key to its downfall.

It isn't easy to leave a high\-control group, let alone decline a pardon *and* make a public apology. I'm not giving a pass to every MAGA supporter but I believe this person is sincere and we *need* more MAGA supporters to see the light and follow suit.

Unfortunately I think she will always be in the minority. People who support Trump have deeply seated issues that would require years of therapy to overcome, and that even assumes that they'd be willing to try. But because their hate has been celebrated and validated, none of them will ever even be aware of their issues, much less address them.

When you have a nation with this unhealthy, over\-the\-top patriotism, where they see themselves as almost divinely chosen, a shining beacon, the biggest, the best, blah blah blah, mixed with insane inequality, a downright inhumane system, and a weird obsession with guns, it’s a recipe for disaster. America is full of decent people, but it’s never really figured out how to build a decent society.

From a global perspective, the big decay of the U.S. began in 2001\. What is happening now is the result of a series of events that have already taken place. Nothing occurs in a vacuum. Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 after witnessing the U.S. carry out a similar action in Iraq just a few years earlier. The war in Ukraine can be seen as an escalation of that dynamic. Now the U.S. is going full bunker mode, taking whatever it believes is theirs. The significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It marked the beginning of internal unrest that gradually spilled out into the world. It also represented the peak of American power. In the end, Bin Laden won.

Post Title:      So the right suddenly wants 30 million more Americans  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
No, what the conservatives want is 30 million Venezuelan slaves. When they fly the Confederate flag, that means slavery and always has meant slavery.

Also, it's not just Venezuelan ones, they'll enslave anyone they don't like, which is basically everyone. "Own the libs" is meant literally, that's why they're all falling in line behind Russian imperialism in more ways than one.

> Right vs. left brainrot. Out-group brainrot mindsets. Human beings behave like this all over the world and throughout history. Out-group domination. Long before "left vs. right" was framing it. If other nations had the wealth, power, military, technology of the USA - Reddit users wouldn't grasp it is driven by masculine domination / power drives that we are not facing. If Russia had twice the power and 10 times the wealth, war with Ukraine and others would be worse. Reddit community mindset (mob mentality of left vs. right USA only) is to avoid American from Atlanta 1954 learning. Stuck in 1931 logic polarity mindsets, Us vs. Them / Left vs. Right. team-sport, gaming, gamer, screen gamer logic of "enemy" humans.

I even went in to see my obgyn a year later and the first thing he said when he walked in was, "Congratulations." I said, "What for?" He said, "Didn't you have a baby?" I said, "No, I lost it." He was mortified and very apologetic, but clearly someone didn't mark it on my file correctly.

My personal favorite class of non\-voters are the twats who abstained from voting or even in some cases voted for Trump over Gaza/Palestine. 

One of the stupidest self\-owns I have ever seen. I get genuinely angry every time I think of the 2024 US election, pisses me right off that we're all in this mess.

Also "the black woman laughed too much". Say what you will about "Biden should have dropped out earlier" and whatever else you want to say, your choice was status quo vs literal criminal, rapist monster and people fucked it up. 

American exceptionalism, domestic and foreign propaganda, as well as media illiteracy has REALLY done a number on the US.

The time for expecting maga to come to reality is over, anyone left is just a thrall at this point and would sacrifice their own loved ones to attempt to look like they are in the right. Any attempt at making sense to them is wasted effort that could be spent elsewhere. They CANNOT and WILL NOT allow themselves to be reasoned with.

> * “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

This is, unfortunately, the only thing that has a chance of saving you. 

You CANNOT vote your way out of this one. 

Democracy was built on the blood of countless aristocrats, and by blood it must be defended. 

Or you *will* be under the heel of fascism for the next 50 years at least. 

It's either deal with this *now*, or civil war, and guerilla warfare for years to come. 

You will also *need* representatives that will prosecute the traitors (like ICE agents) HARD. If they are left to foment, you will have the same issues again and again later down the road. That's if you're even able to get power back to the people. This also includes going after the media that made this possible. You cannot have media moguls in consolidated corporations that controll the news. 

The reason, for example, that we have so little neo nazi activity here in Norway, is not that we're Social Democrats and so god damn progressive that people just don't become radicalized. It's because we executed the Norwegians who joined the Nazis and worked for them during the occupation. 

You might have heard of Quisling. His betrayal was so enormous that his name became synonymous with "traitor" all over the world. He was executed.

New York City and Chicago combined have more than double the population of your entire country. Then there are about 335 million more people here after that. You're the size of Montana. It's a great idea but we are, unfortunately, just far too big for comparison. It's by design. It won't work here. 

It's also a country of people saying "WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING" from their bedrooms because they're too comfy to be the ones to do it.

Anywhere you turn to see more news about this you get tepid responses from the left and outright lies from the right. And absolute ghouls cheering for this murder. It makes me angry and want to lash out. But what good would that do

She was an award winning poet. "On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs" by Renée Nicole Good

i want back my rocking chairs,

solipsist sunsets, 

\& coastal jungle sounds that are tercets from cicadas and pentameter from the hairy legs of

cockroaches.

i’ve donated bibles to thrift stores

(mashed them in plastic trash bags with an acidic himalayan salt lamp—

the post\-baptism bibles, the ones plucked from street corners from the meaty hands of zealots, the

dumbed\-down, easy\-to\-read, parasitic kind):

remember more the slick rubber smell of high gloss biology textbook pictures; they burned the hairs

inside my nostrils,

\& salt \& ink that rubbed off on my palms.

under clippings of the moon at two forty five AM I study\&repeat 

```
           ribosome

           endoplasmic—

           lactic acid

           stamen

```
at the IHOP on the corner of powers and stetson hills—

i repeated \& scribbled until it picked its way \& stagnated somewhere i can’t point to anymore, maybe

my gut—

maybe there in\-between my pancreas \& large intestine is the piddly brook of my soul.

it’s the ruler by which i reduce all things now; hard\-edged \& splintering from knowledge that

used to sit, a cloth against fevered forehead.

can i let them both be? this fickle faith and this college science that heckles from the back of the

classroom

```
           now i can’t believe—

           that the bible and qur’an and bhagavad gita are sliding long hairs behind my ear like mom

```
used to \& exhaling from their mouths “make room for wonder”—

all my understanding dribbles down the chin onto the chest \& is summarized as:

life is merely

to ovum and sperm

and where those two meet

and how often and how well

and what dies there.

I'm increasingly thinking you're right. The Trump administration seems to be full of accelerationists who want to provoke civil conflict to justify fully breaking the established order. Every provocation is worse than the last, because they are trying to push the limits intentionally, to see what the breaking point is (if any) for any non\-brainwashed American.

I keep pointing this out because American's get it in their head that everyone must have shitty healthcare, but literally every other country even 3rd world ones have free or very affordable healthcare. 

Conservatives a month or so ago were saying people from Guatemala were invading America to get take advantage of our healthcare. I'm like, you morons, Guatemala has free healthcare. How about a real terrible war torn nation like Somalia? Ya free healthcare.

Its really JUST the USA at this point. Even the poorest countries have this figured out. Partly because the more people you cover with healthcare, the cheaper it gets, so even poor countries figured out "well just cover everyone then?" 

The thing with American healthcare is certain people get rich on it. And you can't have free or very affordable healthcare, while people are getting rich off it.

Literally one of my psychology professors while I was in grad school told the class that he didn't think Dissociative Identity Disorder was real because "there are so few documented cases, and even some of those were shown to be false". And like. Okay? So maybe this disorder needs to be researched more so that we DON'T just have anecdotal evidence and single case studies from 75 years ago???

There is usually the trouble that to the people currently having a real issue, it is self\-evident that the problem is there, while the professional is confronted with dozens, if not hundreds of situations where people claim something. It is an arduous process to get through plenty of false claims and ideas so you can get to the true ones, worsened if you already have a full plate with dealing with the daily amount of work.

This applies to a lot of liberal arts stuff too. I read a lot of poly sci articles in school and started to wonder "if the only people who read these things are other poly sci scholars, what's the point? who is this helping?" Later I interned for an immigration firm and learned that lawyers cite these types of articles to the judge because they need hard evidence of dangers and atrocities for their asylum clients to be let into the country.

Disgustingly irresponsible for the vice president of the United States to say before an investigation has even been conducted.

These people hate you. Full stop. THEY. HATE. YOU.

It's always just about politics. They don't see humans anymore. Just a connect 4 board and every piece is a chance to 1\-up the other side.

"deranged leftist" is a really pathetic thing for a vp to say.

America is the stupidest fucking place in the world right now.

It’s called pushing a narrative. It’s all the GOP does. For a “facts not feelings” party they can’t help but spout how they feel about a situation even if it’s against the facts of the situation

Vance’s bullshit post illustrates a typical right\-wing tactic: frame the issue with whatever lie is convenient and argue that instead of reality.

The lesson for everyone: NEVER accept right\-wing framing of an issue. Always question both the framing and the premise.

Because ICE is just a name.

This is the norm for a lot of American Christians, unfortunately. If Jesus came back, they would crucify him again for being sympathetic to minorities and the downtrodden.

> At the White House on Thursday, Vance engaged in a lengthy defense of the officer’s actions and said: “\[T]hat very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg. So you think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile.”

So the *defense* is using unaddressed trauma as an affirmative defense for murder?

Instead of a *plaintiff* using it as part of a negligence case for ICE allowing a traumatized lunatic to shoot a US citizen?

Bold strategy, Cotton, let's see how it works out for them.

Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by tech**nological diversions.

I'm from Brazil. Every since the whole shit show with Maduro, I've seen both left and right wing nationalists stating that a country with the natural resources that Brazil has should have nuclear bombs to deter foreign aggression. I cannot state how much this WASN'T a talking point even in the most fringe brazilian politics accounts on Twitter. 

The only thing Trump's foreign policy is accomplishing is making countries that used to have a (somewhat) friendly relationship with the US question what should they do if they become the target of the newest rogue nation on the block.

The people I know who are intelligent and right wing aren’t pizzagate\-style maga, but typically have religious beliefs that supercede reason and preclude them from supporting viable alternatives to MAGA if those candidates are pro\-choice, anti\-school vouches for religious schools, and/or pro\- state funded social safety net. OR they prioritize immediate economic growth over things like environmentalism and other regulations which also find them in bed with MAGA. Just like Romney kicked and screamed about Trump, he ultimately kissed the ring to advance his own agenda just like all the others.

Because that's exactly what this is: Nazi America.

An American citizen and Mom was publicly executed by ICE and the President, VP, and head of DHS said she deserved it.

We are all now targets for any ICE agent to randomly decide he wants to add us to his kill count, for any reason.

The full video is on [r/publicfreakout](/r/publicfreakout) shes hiding in their basement and it’s straight up modern day Nazi Germany vibes. Thank god as they go to hand her over a crowd had started to form and they encouraged the people not too and they seemed to be leaving, no clue how it turned out after the video though

Guess we’re at the point where something as simple as ordering food may lead you to have to choose between “harboring a fugitive” and putting your family at risk of murder from ice.

The thing I keep thinking about is how for the last couple of years the rest of America has got to see the America that black people have always told them about but was just dismissed.

Like if you surveyed various people about how shocked they were about recent events I believe white people would be most shocked and black people not shocked at all.

Yeah that's just the stuff that was on the top of my head. Project 2025 is a straight up dictator's instruction manual, and a badly written one at that. I really do wonder what the breaking point will be. I don't think we're too far off from it though. 

I also wonder at what point our allies will decide to out sanctions on us and when we'll be kicked put of the G7\. Russia was kicked out for its annexation of Crimea, I don't see how this thing with Venezuela is any different.

This is just the beginning IMO.

It’s about normalizing the violence. ICE agents dragging people out of courtrooms, cars, businesses, all unthinkable before and now the norm.

Deaths will tick up. Because they’ve asserted multiple times now on live tv that ICE agents will never be prosecuted. 

And they will be used to terrorize people in unfriendly states during the midterms. Friendly states will ratfuck their results. 

My really out\-there prediction? They close the Jan 6 circle by having ICE detain or execute members of Congress before or shortly after swearing\-in, completing the previously\-attempted coup.

I dont think covering it up is the right word. They know they are lying and they know we know they are lying. 

They are saying we a dictatorship now and we can do and say what we want.

Draining situational public context of depth, shallowing it up, ultra mockery. What Reddit meme aficionado audiences prize { anti-depth. Shallowness, superficial }.

They’ve been doing this, successfully, for a while now. Saying tariffs are helping the economy (and firing the people who track the data that proves otherwise). That affordability is a hoax, and lying to people that everything is, suddenly and without rational explanation, more affordable now. 

That the “world” respects America under their leadership like never before \- when the reality is the world is incredibly disturbed, thinks the administration is dangerous and insane, and that global order is now destabilizing. 

And a hundred other examples I could list here where the administration says the opposite of the truth and the media lets them get away with that 

This time it’s a lie about a murder of a woman, and mother, in cold blood… but this “tell them up is down, the sky is not blue” and getting away with the lies \- is not a new thing from the administration.

You know, Trump wasn't *joking* when he said Democrats and residents of "Blue states" are the "enemies from within." He means that. The US government means that.

If you are not MAGA, your government has declared you an enemy of the state, with no mincing of words.

Conservatives aren’t people of integrity. They know they’re hypocrites. They don’t feel like they have the responsibility to be decent because they know in their hearts they’re right and the far left libs are wrong. They don’t care they’re being shitty people. They revel in it.

They sent air force 2 to pick up Charlie Kirk's body, something they don't even do for fallen soldiers. Something that's usually only reserved for presidents who have passed. For the lady who was murdered in her car, in her very own neighborhood, who is a mother of three, who was killed by an ICE for no justifiable reason, she gets labeled a domestic terrorist. Imagine if this administration showed the same compassion to Renee Good and her family that they did to Charlie Kirk and his family. Oh wait, I can't. The president is a sociopath, and the administration has zero soul.

Post Title:      Q: Do you see any checks on your power on the world stage? Is there anything that could stop you? Trump: Yeah there's one thing, my own morality, my own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me. Q: Not international law? Trump: I don't need international law.

The Founding Fathers meticulously created a nation of checks and balances. And we have these SOBs at the Supreme Court who shredded all of that to let loose this wild animal in the White House.

And Americans tossed it away in favor of Russian Surkov monomyth since March 2013! Even Vince Gilligan's PLUR1BUS TV show isn't good enough to take serious. Minute 37 of co-pilot Episode Two on Air Force One the POTUS Seal is pointing to right-wing of the eagle bird. And people can't seriously discuss this!

Too much evidence pointing to election interference to write it off as "American public voted for this". Also, remember the GOP chuds always project their crimes on to others.

Yeah not quite. At minimum you have decades of brainwashing going on through media and religion.
These people were told to do this.

My grandma is one of them in her church they told them all they had to vote for Trump because of abortions. Single issue voter. My grandma told me straight up she voted for Trump so that the Supreme Court would end abortions.

She says she doesn’t like him or anything he stands for but her church told her that so that’s what she went with.

This is the type of shit we’re dealing with in America.

From our uneducated children to our 90\+\-year\-old grandparents who are only informed by their social groups and churches and Fox News.

As a kid consuming American media, the US always felt such a dream country to me, but now the idea of just visiting as a tourist terrifies me.

I don’t think I would ever feel safe in that country.

Not just a bitch. He called her a "fucking bitch". Most caring cops are devastated if they are forced to use deadly force. This bozo violated orders by putting himself in harm's way, like she was some kind of felon.

Oh, and Renee's last words to her killer? "That's fine, dude \- I'm not mad at you."

Literally here last words were: "I'm not mad at you". She was trying to de\-escalate the situation. That's more what I can say for the ICE officers. It doesn't appear that she was impeding traffic. They could have gotten around her. The ICE officer didn't have to stand directly in front of the car. One officer told her to drive off while another said to get out of the car and pulled aggressively on her door. These confusing commands caused her to panic, and she tried to flee the situation. This was entirely preventable, and ICE escalated a situation that didn't need to be escalated, and now a woman and a mother of three is dead.

It's been getting this way for a long time. I used to consider myself very moderate right. But every time we get a new Republican neighbor it's constant legal battles as they try to steal, trespass, and destroy everything around them. Then have their buddy cops defend them and even try to pujure themselves in court for them. Luckily I document everything and know how to pull body cams in my state and have been able to thwart them after lengthy legal battles. 

Sad thing is most of these people are well off and seem to just do these things because they can and they think no one should be allowed to tell them what to do ever, including the law.

Post Title:      An actual Christian woman, Renee Good, on a mission trip in Ireland.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
From this [BBC news article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g49wzw58yo). Unlike the man who shot her and the administration that continues to vilify her, Renee was a Christian woman who walked the walk.

Per her wife:

"Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world and we need to do everything we can to find it where it resides and nurture it where it needs to grow. Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole."

Edit: To the MAGA "Christians" who keep saying she wasn't a real Christian: Jesus Christ, the guy Christians supposedly follow, stepped in to stop state\-sanctioned violence. When a woman is about to be executed under the law, Jesus says,*“Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone”*(John 8:7\). The crowd leaves and the execution doesn’t happen. That’s intervening directly in a legal punishment, the same thing Mrs. Good was doing. She is more Christ\-like than anyone in this administration.

I don't think "God" could have put it more on the nose if He tried. 

Their evil is killing good people. 

They "religious right" don't follow the teachings of their own Christ.

C*hecks notes* wait ICE isn't authorized to perform traffic stops on US citizens what were they even doing there in the first place??

And she was a Christian. It matters the same way the other things you listed matter.

She believed in and followed Christ's teachings to love immigrants and it just exposes that MAGA Christians like murderer Jonathan Ross follow a demented, twisted version of the religion.

Americans need to shut their country down and take the power away from these psychopaths.

Mass protests are a great start, but a general strike is a tool the population does not use readily enough.

This administration is going to boil the frog until there’s nothing left to remember America from just a couple of years ago.

It's really important that the U.S. begins to pay a price for its reckless belligerence. They have the power to take Greenland \- but what will it cost? Their friends \- while they are still friends \- need to make it abundantly clear that the U.S. will be isolating and impoverishing itself, more and more, the further it proceeds on this course.

It feels to me that Trump is REALLY sick. You can see he’s not doing well at all. He looks like he’s already circling the drain. I’m pretty sure he knows this, and is trying to do something… ANYTHING of consequence so he has some kind of legacy. He’s throwing spaghetti at a bunch of walls and hoping something sticks.

please for the love of god. We need sanctions too. throw the god damn book at us. This is fucking insane.

I understand that most of the response is up to us Americans, and I kind of wish it was a few months ago but we are heading down a really scary path right now\- whether the admin intended for heightened emotions to happen or not.

Lets use Jan6 as an example. Watching the exact same footage.

One side says it was an insurrection.

The other side says it wasnt that bad, it was a peaceful protest, Capitol Police were letting people inside to watch the proceedings, Ashley Babbit was a victim of police brutality.

Already seeing the exact same impact here.

I'm confused why those in\-favor of the shooting are flaunting this video like it's some kind of "gotcha". The officer who supposedly was in a life\-threatening situation never left his feet. Hell, he never even dropped his fucking phone.

I genuinely don't understand how anyone who isn't a psychopath can watch that video and say "yeah that lady was trying to kill him. She deserved to get executed point\-blank."

If the US moves beyond endless rhetoric about invading and starts taking concrete steps, the entire globe\* needs to drop trade sanctions on all US goods and services, including/especially social media.

It's stupid because highly democratic countries tend to be more prosperous and stable. Democracy forces politicians to govern responsibly. If the citizens abandon democratic norms during times of hardship, they will actually make things worse. It's like they don't pay attentikn to how things go in existing autocracies.

Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways. :::

I can admit that we sometimes romanticise the struggle, but it's not an easy time to be an adult in this generation. We can barely afford anything, especially the old things that used to drive people like a house or kids. School has been heavily devalued, and our hopes and dreams have been away even before it began.

Edit: grammar, would also like add that it hurts even more because we were promised so much more about the "future".

Exactly. Possession is 9/10 of the law as far as he's concerned.

I have not found any level of pettiness that he's not willing to resort to.

He'll gladly take it from her and still support the existing regime so long as it gives him that oil money in offshore accounts.

Maybe she'll get a powerless position in the new old regime if she can behave herself and keep praising Trump.

I have but one hope, and that is that we don’t have a repeat of the Biden years where “we just try to look forward and move on.”

That’s stupid boomer bullshit. THIS is what happens when you try to “move forward” without holding people accountable.

This is common behavior amongst rightwing people.

Over last couple of months I've been observing many political discussions, mostly on demonstrations with average people, and it doesn't matter the topic (climate change is not real, vaccines don't work, Trump is the best, etc.) by simply asking how or why something is the way it is, maybe 2\-3 times digging a bit deeper with each step, you can always see their worldview collapse in their eyes resulting in either aggression or flat out leaving the scene.

Their entire mentality was build up by a lack of education, media propaganda and a lack of willpower to overcome the primal instincts such as tribalism or male superiority. Imagine all of it as a giant skyscraper standing on such flimsy legs that simple questions can cause it to fall over resulting in an earthquake of emotions, mostly self\-doubt and hate. 

Which makes these people ticking time\-bombs.

Most men in America are spoiled boys power tripping. Like Peter Theil or Elon Musk. 

They watch daddy Trump act up and take note.

That's some serious bullshit. Before she started ordering them online and keeping well stocked, I had a gallery on my phone of each box and their barcode so I could make sure to get exactly the ones she wanted.

Why wouldn't you want to do things to help your wife? What kind of asshole does that?

It’s not about the period products, it’s about being “used” by his wife. I dated someone similar, they explained that they didn’t want to be “used” and refused to do anything that didn’t also directly benefit him. Which is crazy bc I was constantly doing selfless things for him bc that’s what you do in a relationship!!! Basically, it’s not about a period, it’s about this man being too lazy to get out of car to buy something that isn’t directly for him. And yes, the sex was exactly how you would imagine it would be with someone in that mindset.

When republicans bring up Kirk I just say

“His attackers bail should be posted, if someone did that they’d be a hero. Besides what did they expect would happen when they said the things they said?”

Then when they lose their shit I inform them that this is actually me quoting his public responses to both Paul Pelosi’s attack \& Melissa Hortmans murder.

When ice started kidnapping and "deporting people", they said "well obmama did it too" (turns out Obama did, but also not in the same way)

So... They supported Obama? They should come out with their love for Obama.

But they can't understand that.

They aren't normal people.

They themselves are who they think others are, and they're afraid of mirrors.

This was in early 2011, before Trump became the nonstop constant center of USA society June 16, 2015. Perfect book { Torah, Quran, Bible }. People seem unwilling to break free from dogma. Be it a subreddit or a certain business organization or sport, whatever, people latch on trees and do not see the forest. Russia thinking about Ukraine is just self-harm to Russia.

It depends what measures are being used to gauge performance:

If you consider as a professional immigration police\-force then it’s a shambles. They’ve recruited bigoted zealots and losers, barely trained them, with predictable results

If its actual purpose is to intimidate, create domestic fear, all under pretence of being “law enforcement” then Trump is getting the value he wants.

These are “brown\-shirts” in all\-but\-name. And their purpose is the same.

It’s not stupid, so much as by design, and this is the phase of the fascist blueprint America is entering.

This is always a false narrative, too. Most people mocked that he was being celebrated. He was a podcaster, shock jock and disliked everyone who was not white male Christian. Women were ok if they stayed in their lane.

People mocked exalting such a man. Few mocked the man as deserving to die. MAGA as a whole is saying she deserved to die.

I'm not normally a person who attends protests, but I figure if there's ever a time that it's worth doing, it's when the government is asserting the right to murder protestors with impunity. It's important to demonstrate we're not scared of these shitstains

Meaningless protest until it's in front of the homes of the very Senators and representatives, They are not present in government buildings when protests happen, so they never hear your voice, they rather be in Washington or holed up elsewhere on party dinners and functions, unaware of the things going on.

How long do peaceful protests work? I say they aren't working at all. When is enough enough? How do you fix something voting can't fix? No Kings did Jack shit.

It won't. If this is not successful (and it won't be unless Iranian armed forces cause an internal rupture), just give it just a few years and people will forget. I remember the "pray for Venezuela" trend in 2014 and in 2017, but today, no one remembers what Venezuela had to endure and that there ever were protests against the Regime and the massacres commited, and they don't even recognize that it is a dictatorship.

If the Iranian people succeed now, reddit is gonna get flooded with "CIA backed coup", "artificial color revolution backed by the US", and "Free the Ayatollahs".

This mindset and backards view of international affairs is in part the reason why not a single country has efectively evolved to democracy during the 21st century, in opposition to the last quarter of the 20th century.

Trump says protestors doing any kind of damage should be shot on sight here in the US. But he also says the Iranian government better not harm protestors. Not sure how he doesn’t see the parallels.

It didn't JUST go to shit, and people before you literally had generations that became adults and went to war to die.

The problem is things were getting better and with the Internet things advanced globally so much that people began to think the stuff that is our history was just that...forgetting that history, regardless of what advancements you now have, always repeats itself unless you actively prevent it.

Impeachment will never happen. But I don't disagree with you. I just think they should be doing so much more. We need real action. We need civil disobedience. Democrats could lead and organize and fund and build genuine resistance to this tyranny. But they aren't.

Your theory is "keep on losing and someday you'll win"? By the time we finally win we will have lost so much that we only win back half of what we lost.

Your strategy may have worked for Suffrage, when White women got the right to vote, but for the last 50 years it has only lead to a complete destruction of the working class. The Democrats may campaign for the voters, but they still govern for the donors. America sucks because the people have zero expectations and settle for performative dipshittery.

“Given the devotion of Trump’s cult in Congress, there’s no way an impeachment effort will end with the removal of the president.

Do it anyway. The rule of law is meaningless if you only take it up when it’s easy.”

This. The longer you wait for accountability, the less likely it’s ever going to come.

This part especially stood out as enraging corruption: “Meanwhile, the government vehicle involved in the incident was driven
to Maine, more than 1,000 miles from Chicago. DHS "ordered the Border Patrol in\-house mechanic to buff out all of the alleged damage
\- in this case, a paint swap, essentially," Parente alleged to HuffPost. "At which point, we were unable to have our expert look at it and show that it was actually the ICE agent's car that side\-swiped her car ... We were in the middle of that destruction\-of\-evidence hearing when they dismissed the case."

They murdered someone, immediately came out and lied about it, and now they are sending *more* agents into Minnesota who feel emboldened and are literally just intentionally antagonizing Minnesotans. All over Minnesota, not just Minneapolis. 

This is not normal behavior. They are sadistic, irredeemable ghouls. States need to be ready to protect their people from the federal government.

Just to add a bit more context, I live in a sleepy suburb/exurb, nothing ever happens here, and ICE is all over just antagonizing residents for no reason. They do not have a plan, these aren't sophisticated operations, they don't have any reason to be here and they are just improvising. Their orders appear to be enrage residents as much and as quickly as they can. I haven't met one Minnesotan in real life who is OK with this or wants them here. The only crime happening here is by ICE.

Also less serious but these fucking morons don't have any idea how to drive in the snow and ice and they've also been causing accidents and traffic jams because they don't know how to drive. I also saw one dude lookin like Ralphie in the Christmas Story all bundled up in shit, it's 30 degrees this is sweatshirt weather.

I just don't get how so many "leaders" immediately came out saying what happened without any reasonable facts. Trump used words outside his vocabulary describing her as a lunatic pretty much, noem said the agents were stuck in snow in a clear plowed street. And Vance claimed agents are immune. Growing up if anything involved a officer, which ICE is not a law enforcement, the officer was immediately put on paid administrative leave pending the investigation. This dude just called her a bitch and got in his car and left. Nobody has said he is in leave or is cooperating with the investigation. As far as I can presume he is out on the streets doing his "ICE business"

Not sure if this had been said but I think the administration is thrilled that this happened to a white lady. They released the cell phone video of a non threatening interaction with an average, pleasant white lady. Then they reinforced their lie that she was a terrorist attempting to kill. In my mind they’re actually telling us to fuck off, they can and will kill anyone they want. There are no rules just thug rule.

Post Title:      A Disturbing Pattern Has Emerged In Trump's Second Term - And It's Playing Out With Renee Good  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I agree that "a disturbing pattern has emerged in Trump's second term," but it sure isn't a NEW pattern, even for Trump, who has a long history of distortion and outright fabrication.

A quote from the article: 

> *"Normally, I would think the government wouldn’t be so brazen about misinformation,” Parente said.*

It's the "brazen" part that seems to be on the rise. For a very long time, we have seen impunity for law enforcement when it comes to what the rest of us see as "excessive use of force." For a long time, this pattern has been in force in *many if not most* locales, such that, 

> *"The approach of our government right now is to literally implement the death penalty for minor traffic offenses on the spot, and that is extremely troubling."*

This is a longstanding pattern. the Trump Administration has just made it more blatant. Will we be able to leverage that brazenness to get some recognition of the *longstanding pattern* of officers being able to be "judge, jury and executioner" when a citizen does not follow their orders? 

The officer who placed himself in front of the vehicle was also disobeying his own training. His was the first step in creating the crisis.

Post Title:      Tucker Carlson slams right for seeking ‘political points’ from Minnesota shooting  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
It’s Tucker, it’s not that he disagrees with what happened, he just disagrees with the republicans pressing their advantage. The video speaks for itself, and the only ones claiming it was self defense are already radicalized maga members\- it’s not coming from the center, the center that will determine the next elections… that might create a democratic majority… it’s not worth the risk to them to Stan for the murderer if it undoes everything they are trying to do.

At this point the only thing that might save the republicans is a murder or attack on ice agents they can tie to the democrats, or a bunch of protests across that country that turn violent.

I think Dems should do old fashion sit down protests. Can’t ever claim that protestors are the agitators if they are sitting cris cross apple sauce singing protest songs\- though I would love to see the far right try.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
[Archive link](https://archive.ph/2Zrzy)

> The Trump administration announced that it would suspend funding of food stamps and other hunger relief programs in Minnesota just as a federal judge blocked a similar effort to freeze funding for social services amid allegations of widespread fraud in the state.
> 
> Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, posted a letter addressed to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota saying that she would suspend payment of $129 million in federal funding from the Agriculture Department, citing unfolding investigations of fraud in Minnesota’s social safety net, which have involved members of the Somali\-American community.

Whenever Republicans want to do something totally immoral and/or illegal, they simply cook up a lie or conspiracy theory to justify it.

> Mocking "Fox News dumb", and "Church is dumb" does not educate people on WHY. Gullibility is driven by billionaires mocking poor people, rural less educated people.

People can no longer imagine a society where people are sincere, honest, and not tricking them!

Agreed. Unlike many, I can kind of forgive the Trump 1 voters because his platform was "drain the swamp," and if you weren't in the Northeast in the 80's\-90's, you might not have realized just how bad of a choice he was. (Okay, they could've done their research, but bear with me). 

The idiots that voted for Trump 2 know he was an awful choice between round 1, his attempted coup, his openly bragging about how he can't help but grab genitals of people he's attracted to, his openly racist claims, his felonies... I won't run the full list. But knowing that and voting for him is a particular form of stupid.

Boy was I wrong. Didn't take long at all to figure that out. That was nearly 10 years ago....how people still buy his schtick is beyond me. Well, I know, it's a cult so I do understand but still.

No Trump voter is redeemable. We have to start realizing who they are \- they are the people who gleefully watch ICE murder innocent civilians. They will laugh at anyone’s death so long as they are labeled “lib” and trump says it’s fine. They will cheer on ICE shooting kids, women, everyone. 

These people will never switch sides, nor should they ever be forgiven for who they voted for. They should live in shame for the rest of their lives and never be allowed in civilization again.

Lol, all the moderates and democrats did ever since 911 was "taking the high road" and try to follow rules while the conservatives just saw that as them being weak and has since then steam rolled them. Trump just kicked that policy into high gear and removing any pretence, and they still tried to be complacent until today. Now you have expensive, fascist goons kidnapping and killing people on the streets and people are on the fence whether protesting is justified.

I’ve been pretty good all through the pandemic and all the crazy shit since…but lately I’ll admit, I feel like we need to intervene and just arrest these maniacs running the federal govt. I realize that can’t happen, but I’m not sure we’re make it to the midterm elections and any constitutional order before we are just absolutely destroyed as a country and a society. I mean I can really see that we are on the way to being irreparably fucked to the point where life as we’ve known it is over.

Why does ICE keep coming after defenseless women? They can't reasonably claim they are dangerous, or the "worst of the worst"! Why don't we Minnesotans have any protection against ICE? Why won't the police help us? Why isn't there any state or federal protection for us? WHY????

Hi y’all! I am the person who made this cake. Thanks to everyone who commented, even the critics! This is not a tobacco ad, or an intervention cake. Just something silly I did for someone I love. Sort of an inside joke. I didn’t realize how many people it would offend, but I think that means I did a decent job. I definitely wasn’t expecting this much feedback. 

This is a carrot cake for those asking. No raisins. The flavors actually paired really well with the pretzel cigarettes. Oreo crumbs without the cream for the ash, but I’ve seen silver and white sanding sugar, crushed black sesame or even just white sugar dyed with black food coloring. I took inspiration from a similar cake I saw, just added a few extra details. It was supposed to be a funny but it’s kind of cool that it’s offending people, no offense.

Not only are the mask\-wearing unarmed\-citizen\-shooting insurgents are domestic terrorists, their handlers proudly claimed all of them are at CPAC. 

This is an insurgent government overall. They revolt against established law and order, and force their own will, against the law, against the Constitution, against the people.

All the fuss of Hamas being elected in is going to sound familiar about us in a decade or two. Once Hamas had majority seats (they were not voted in by the majority) in parliament, they obstructed until they forced "unity" in their favor, then they rounded up opposition and killed them, taking over entirely.

a) fox new, et al. saying it's domestic terrorism and them constantly saying the guy was ran over by her just making sure they are kept brain washed.

b) he's a government official. He's going to say what he needs to say regardless of what he really believes

c) doesn't actually give a shit, and probably things anyone who isn't maga existing should be considered a domestic terrorist as the whole fascist mindset has to have their ingroup and outgroup to work

d) all of the above

This is entire problem with the administration and why they're so afraid of midterm elections. Too many of them openly admitted they respect and emulate Nazi ideology and the majority of Americans are saying "Nope, fuck this" and refusing to vote for the Republican party hence most of the elections for Congress being swept by Democrats.

There is a crying wolf problem here. If your administration's knee jerk reaction to anything like this is to label the victim a domestic terrorist, the truth will eventually out. 

Sure, the MAGA die hards will slurp up that tripe, but the rest of us will be less likely to believe the government the next time they claim the person they shot was a terrorist.

Can certain liberal\-leaning outlets just stop already with the “Sent Into A Panic”, “On Their Heels”, “Walls Closing In” headlines?

This is liberal catnip. Either this is a ruthless fascist regime or it isn’t. Ruthless fascist regimes do not panic. They do what they want and they do not care if they’re popular. It is unhealthy and delusional to believe otherwise in 2026, and these sorts of headlines are not helping.

Insiders whined that she was stoking distrust in ICE, law enforcement, and government? Yeah, ok. That’s the regime’s objective in the first place.

Don't forget to include the other (and arguably equally important) part of the quote where he implied the United States "probably" had boats there **500** years ago too.

The guy doesen't give a fuck about the irony of his comments (regarding the native people that lived there), but even worse he has no idea of how long the States has even existed. The guy thinks American boats were there centuries before the country even existed.

*binary processing alert*

Here: Shooting a gun in the air is illegal *because it is randomly murderous.*

So, yeah. The guy committing unknowable indescriminate harm on his community was absolutely the person who escalated the situation.

That doesn't mean he *deserved* to die.

It *does* mean that your binary moral posturing is complete horseshit.

This. Literally live in the greater twin cities area and if I didn't go online my life would be just about as uneventful and quiet as ever. Unfortunately social media is part of my work.

It's healthier to focus on your own happiness, improve the lives of those close to you, volunteer for your local shelter, give back, and enjoy life.

Dude I see so many relationship posts in the smaller private subs I'm in where they'll explain all their issues, problems, resentments, etc. and then when asked if they've ever brought this up and talked about it they act like that's a wild idea! Who'd ever do that!? 

Don't you know your spouse should just know!?

I'll never understand how people can be married for decades, claim to love their spouse and be very close and have a massive list of things they aren't allowed to talk about.

My favorite thing about relationships is the fact that you can talk about anything. But at the top of my list is someone with an open mind who likes talking about weird things.

*"Oh we just don't talk about that..."* is bizarre to me.

I've been in a relationship for 16 years, married for 12\.

People underestimate how much *baggage* certain topics can have. My wife and I have had literally dozens of big fights and hundreds of small ones, just over the topic of sex. It is the biggest source of conflict between us by far, and we're both veritable minefields when it comes to that. Navigating that minefield is something that takes tremendous amounts of energy for both of us, and there's always the chance it blows up out of nowhere because one of us was already in a bad mood because of something else. 

Sometimes it's just easier to be slightly unhappy *maybe* and not risk a big fight or worse. Like a wise man once said: Sex is like pizza; even when it's bad, it's still *pretty good*.

That said, people should absolutely try to communicate. It's just often easier said than done.
