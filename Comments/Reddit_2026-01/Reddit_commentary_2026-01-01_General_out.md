That’s putting it mildly. Straight up blasphemy. He should be prosecuted and have the book thrown at him.

Edit: Very surprised with the number of people here who don’t realize “blasphemy” can be used outside the context of religion.

For example: “it’s blasphemous to put pineapple on pizza!!”

(Btw, it’s not \- pineapple and jalapeno pizza is delicious. Fight me.)

That sounds great, but this keeps happening, and they have never shown any ability to retain the information or their thought about it. 

They can be lividly angry about something Trump did, but two days later they will appear to have no knowledge about it. 

They will complain about some damn thing that doesn't effect them or anybody they know, and then get really offended when something they said two days ago is brought up for "being political". The more contrived and made up the perceived threat, the more they are concerned about it. 

There are some of them starving in ditches terrified that litter\-boxes are being installed in elementary schools for cat\-identifying kids. 

Never happened once, but if it did, why is that more important than universal healthcare? 

If you ask them, the answer if they don't want to pay for someone else's healthcare. That is just a shit point of view for people that worship sociopaths. Every other industrialized country has done the fucking math (and many non\-industrialized countries) and figure out that universal health care is just a better system.

Why do people that call themselves conservative in the US worship sociopaths as leaders? This really hasn't been the case over the last 40 years, and has weirdly accelerated after the USSR fell apart.

I haven't been following, but what is all this? Are we attacking Venezuela under the pretext of 'fighting cartels' with the actual intention of securing oil? 

Because it *feels* like this is a situation where we are attacking Venezuela under the pretext of 'fighting cartels' with the actual intention of securing oil.

ETA: Trump just said he will put US boots on the ground if needed.

ETA 2: Uh...we do not control the country. As per the NY Times:

Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela’s interim president, is delivering an address to the nation and taking a much more defiant tone than President Trump suggested. Trump said she had agreed to help the United States run Venezuela. She said the United States invaded Venezuela under false pretenses and that Maduro is Venezuela’s “only president.”

It’s not really a distraction— it was the secret enigmas that bound the wealthy and powerful together.

It’s cocaine and homeless hunting.

While PR agencies sane wash our billionaires. Everyone else is falling into a debt abyss.

China is selling and not buying treasury bonds. The world is rerouting trade. And we finally end the distractions from the Epstein files to get the Epstein files as a massive change to our economic system takes place.

$2\.7 trillion is cleared through the DCCS. This is the most important thing to distract us from[https://youtu.be/\-sD1vz4GVSk](https://youtu.be/-sD1vz4GVSk)

EDIT: had to correct dollar figure and DCCC. Anyway, I’d like to add this is a transition to a new paradigm that makes us more dependent on a fantasy economy. You either invest in the Emperor’s new clothes or he blows up the economy and you have nothing.

Meanwhile, I expect the greedy psychos behind Trump to both support this move with their media outlets and to convert to non US and non fiat currencies and thus undermine the scheme. They’ve got one foot in the fantasy nothingburger kingdom and one foot in an escape bunker. They maybe crazy but they aren’t idiots.

Post Title:      Trump, the peace president, invades our neighbor, Venezuela.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
You wouldn't believe the amount of conservatives who wanna hand wave this away as a "military action"

Motherfucker really? If Germany decided trump is guilty of their laws and come over here with their military and blow shit up and literally kidnap trump...that is an act of war. Pure and simple.

God damn man, when the pendulum swings back the other way and if there is no legal action against trump and ALL his cronies then the united states is beyond redemption. This is unprecedented. It cannot stand and no one should be happy about this

Thread was immediately brigaded by bots. 200\+ comments in 30 minutes is not normal.  
 Gonna use this comment to remind you all that it is not normal to fantasise about war and killing people. These extreme comments are likely bots and bad actors, but in case any of you are also starting to think like this \- stop.  
 Get off of Reddit. Go outside.  
 The world is scary right now and it's normal to be afraid. I'm afraid.  
 But our response cannot be advocating violence and spreading violent rhetoric.  
 Should we be prepared if terrible things happen? Yes.  
 Should we actively cheer for violence, nukes, and killing? No.  
 Again, I want to believe these comments are mostly bots. But in case some of you are real \- get offline, please.

But it is so anti-wiki, anti-FAQ, anti-goodness following Trump's lead of just removing history by high-speed media content. By doing antics like this flag event, or addressing drug abuse issues with military weapons. Rich people still get recreational drugs, this is about dominating poor nations and poor drug users. It's about luxuries (drugs and entertainment) for the rich and prison for the poor.

Post Title:      Trump boasts of new "Donroe Doctrine" - but what is it?  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
This. 

This is a huge issue and makes any sort of discourse useless. 

You can no longer defend your side of a debate with facts, because facts have (somehow) become on par with opinions. 

The earth being flat is not my opinion just because you disagree. You are WRONG because what you are saying is demonstrably false.

> The phrase "alternative facts" originated on January 22, 2017, when Kellyanne Conway, then Counselor to President Trump, used it on NBC's Meet the Press to defend White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false claims about the attendance numbers at Donald Trump's inauguration. Chuck Todd, the interviewer, challenged this, stating, "Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods," highlighting the moment as a pivotal instance of political rhetoric"

People have made the case for billionaires ruling with advertising and marketing, and people can't promote The Little Gal Jen Senko on Reddit comments.

People din't to their video games, sports games, Formula 1 world travelers on private jets, their kitten images (or at least do a kitten image that says "impeach Trump and reform MAGA, no more hate!", the FIFA World Cup and FIFA peace prize, the mocking of actresses on Strangers Things.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

I really do not understand why someone downvotes a legitimate question with no comment whatsoever. Are you that unhappy with your own life you just feel the need to crap on someone else asking for help? That's the reason why I stopped posting on Arqade/Stack Overflow, and the same stuff happens here too.

I've never been more reminded of my narcissistic father than in that moment. It's like they took it straight out of his playbook.

My dad would never do anything for anyone if he didn't think they were going to kiss his ass afterwards. "You didn't say thank you,' is something I would imagine the devil of Christianity would say.

Drumpf is quite literally one of the worst people to exist in the world in the tech age and the only real problem is how many other people in the world are stupid enough to not notice. History will not be kind to this guy nor anyone who is selfish enough to fall for his bullshit.

Standing next to lavish things and beautiful women gets Trump attention for what he stands next to! This is not difficult to demonstrate across his entire life.

How much more abuse do you need to see than a girl on a school bus having her and friends shot, in the head, for blogging against old men? How can you possibly not see the need to mention Malala's name as often as people mention Epstein name? Don't let men run all around the world abusing women. It is not a NATIONAL issue, it is a human species evolution of society issue! It is an EDUCATION issue to see this is a problem with girls / women being abused systemically everywhere on Earth!

Trump kidnapped the guy and his wife. No occupying force. Seemingly no major regime change. Trump expects to control everything while Venezuelas resources are plundered. Who is dealing with who? I smell a rat. Either deals have already been done behind the scenes (in Russia), or its going to get ugly.

Look, 2025 is in the past now. It's headed to the history books and we can see what the Democratic "resistance" in Congress looked like with 20/20 hindsight.

Are people seriously arguing that a legacy of "they tried and failed to impeach Trump 50 times while he was doing all those crimes" would look *worse than what actually happened in 2025*? Seriously?

It's not all him. He's just a useful idiot the shadow players failed to harness in his first term. 

There are thinktanks that have spent decades strategizing this exact point in history and they worked hard to put him back so they could advance their plan. 

Their plan had a name and they are following it. They only released the first half of their Plan 2025 for everyone to see. 

They knew the second half of the plan would turn our stomachs. The second half is getting warmed up right now.

Edit: for some reason you guys are confused. Love as in love taking advantage of US stupidity. Both Russia and Israel have a nice tight leash on the US government. No one actually loves us. The world thinks we are stupid and we make it hard to dispute.

On Pluribus subreddit, people celebrate mocking intelligent people with "outplurbed" and similar street-gangs of celebrating ignorance. The pro-ignorance Fox News society far dominates the world now. Malala's pro-education didn't win. Only a tiny fraction, say 3 or 5%, of people think intelligent nonfiction learning is desirable. Others want to drown the world in ignorance that leads to violence and health care system diseases and death (another form of violence, economic violence, red tape health insurance papers violence).

Yet, the attitude of cutting off dialog (which Gilligan is criticizing, I think) doesn't address it. The drunk drivers still drive drunk even if their family members cut them off from their life. News reports of accidents show this! Drug abusers, Walter White meth, don't get addressed. There are people, predators, selling and making these drugs.

I wonder when will people realize that just talking online won't do shit. I mean sure, it doesn't hurt to keep it in your memory and just talk about it, but it feels like that's only all of us do. With the spread of social media we just talk and talk and feel we're doing something, but we don't do shit. 

At this point Trump can just get outside with a photo of him on the island and a girl and brag about what he did, and his people would still defend him.

Since December: 

\- Changed name of Kennedy Center.  
 \- Seized Venezuelan Ship.  
 \- Villainized Somalis.  
 \- ACA wasn’t renewed.  
 \- Faked Child Care story.  
 \- Bombed Venezuela.  
 \- Defunded Child Cares.  
 \- Kidnapped Maduro.  
 \- Changed Vax Schedule for Kids.  
 \- Ignored Epstein Redaction Deadline. 

We definitely should keep the pressure on with Epstein Files, but maybe we should also consider giving some attention to the traitorous congressmen who refuse to stop him. We actually have some power over elected representatives. 

This is their fault just as much as it’s his.

Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, manipulating people. Training grounds for hate and dehumanization every hour of every day.
> 
> Since year 1776, foundation of the nation, no media systems have ever been this fast. Colors have never been this bright, images have never been this this vibrant and common! The denial of the power of billionaires running press / the richest man in the world purchasing Twitter and the impact on human behavior. Reddit image addicts are the worst at recognizing what has changed: A HDTV television star, a man on television every single day since June 16, 2015 - has driven a television society, television audience into mindless brain rot and cheering up hate and war as entertainment and amusement!
> 
> Last year, year 2025, was the 40th year since a book was published on this crisis of the ENTIRE NATION of image addicts. Time Magazine, a long established news source in USA before Reddit was ever created. Before Twitter was able to be purchased by Elon Musk! Before fiction addictions took over nonfiction learning.

So he won't say 'cancel the election', then says it anyway, but says he can't say it because if he did then the "fake news" would report that he wants to cancel the elections... since he said he wants to cancel the elections. Got it.

It's not that they're having trouble removing him. It's that they aren't even trying. The GOP is 100% complicit and are passively approving every illegal move this administration is making. Any impeachment proceedings would require assistance from the GOP, and outside of a couple of outliers, none of them are willing to put their necks on the line for the good of the country. They'd rather keep getting their campaign money from the party and not risk getting primaried next election. 

Truly the most spineless and selfish group of people we could possibly have running the country.

This is escalating way too fast. It’s surreal. It feels like I’ll go to sleep and, seven hours later when I wake up, some shit will have gone down

It’s a dangerously irresponsible game to play. This will only embolden countries to further bully smaller nations. While coercion in international politics already exists through economic power and other means, using military force to coerce a smaller, weaker country like Denmark is absolutely horrific

It’s plain bullying and I doubt anyone in Europe will do anything about it. Grandstanding in meetings and signing a condemnation note is different from facing the reality! 

I doubt military will be used (at least, I hope it isn’t). However, I sense that the USA, through its bullying tactics, will force Denmark to declare Greenland as joined autonomous territory under USA and Denmark or something weird like that

I doubt we will use military force. But if Denmark invokes article 5 two things could happen. Either we have a big war on our hands or nothing will happen, one certainty is that NATO will no longer exist.

American bases in Europe would be gone, and American power projection will be severely hampered. Key allies will be gone, giving China a good chance at taking Taiwan. Russia will still be too weak to really endanger Europe though so that's good.

Russia is still too weak to endanger Europe, but the danger is that Europe will be attacked from both sides, by the US from the west, and by Russia from the east.

I could tell when CNN was immediately speaking positively after the bombs first started dropping in Venezuela. I kept telling myself it feels like i’m watching FoxNews because they didn’t mention any negatives. Everything was talking about how the US will be embraced by the Venezuelans despite being bombed.

Donald Trump has received many millions of dollars in support from the oil and gas industry over multiple election cycles, with especially heavy backing in his 2024 comeback campaign. These donations come both as direct contributions and much larger sums routed through super PACs and outside spending groups.\[1]\[2]\[3]\[4]

2024 election cycle
-------------------

* Climate Power estimates that oil and gas–linked donors spent about **96 million dollars** in “direct donations” to support Trump’s 2024 presidential bid and his super PACs from January 2023 through November 2024\.\[1]
* The same analysis reports nearly **80 million dollars** in pro‑Trump and pro‑Republican advertising funded by fossil‑fuel interests during that cycle.\[1]
* A New York Times review found that individuals and entities tied specifically to oil and gas interests gave **more than 75 million dollars** to Trump‑aligned PACs in the 2024 race, with major checks from executives at firms such as Continental Resources, Energy Transfer, Hilcorp and others.\[2]

Direct industry contributions
-----------------------------

* OpenSecrets’ industry breakdown for 2023–2024 lists Trump as the **top federal recipient** of contributions from the oil and gas industry, with about **2\.1 million dollars** reported in direct, regulated contributions (campaign plus leadership PAC), which excludes most super‑PAC money.\[5]\[3]
* OpenSecrets’ broader “Top Industries” breakdown for Trump’s 2024 campaign also shows oil and gas among his largest donor industries, reflecting a strong partisan tilt of that sector toward Republicans.\[3]\[6]

Super PAC and dark‑money support
--------------------------------

* Trump’s main super PAC, MAGA Inc., has raised nearly **200 million dollars** in one recent reporting period, with a substantial share of large checks coming from donors connected to fossil fuels and related energy infrastructure.\[4]
* Reporting indicates that Trump privately urged oil executives at Mar‑a‑Lago in 2024 to collectively raise **1 billion dollars** for his campaign, framing it as a “deal” compared with the taxes and environmental regulations he pledged to roll back.\[7]\[8]\[2]

What “oil company donations” means in practice
----------------------------------------------

* Much of this money does not come as corporate checks from oil companies directly to Trump’s campaign, which federal law restricts, but rather from **company executives, owners, and associated PACs** who work in oil, gas, and related services.\[9]\[2]\[3]
* Industry spending also includes **lobbying and issue‑advocacy ads** that are not counted as direct campaign donations but are aimed at influencing elections and policy in Trump’s favor.\[3]\[1]

I mean, Rex Tillerson was Secretary of State. It's not even something conspiratorial or hidden, at all. Trump has directly talked about going to Venezuela for the oil, for the benefit of our oil companies.

Further to your point; the oil companies have not yet made a decision whether to extract Venezuelan oil or not. There is also a higher chance they won’t in the short term than will due to the inherent risks involved. 

So the historical narrative may end up being the US kidnapped another country’s leader on trumped up (pun intended) charges, for no pay off.

JFC what a dangerously inept group of grifting greedy a\-holes:

> But Latin America experts have countered that “Cartel de los Soles” is actually a slang phrase coined in the 1990s by the Venezuelan media to describe government officials who accept narco money as bribes.

A revised DOJ document issued after Maduro’s capture now claims Maduro only supported the drug\-money patronage system, along with his predecessor and mentor, President Hugo Chávez.

...

> “I think the new indictment gets it right, but the designations are still far from reality,” Dickinson said. “Designations don’t have to be proved in court, and that’s the difference. Clearly, they knew they could not prove it in court.”

The guy has repeatedly said \- even when winners like Linsdey Graham tried and failed to keep him on narrative/messaging control \- that oil contracts were even discussed before deposing Maduro.

They had this grift all planned and ready to go and, as per usual, used their MSM puppets to promulgate a false pretext for this action.

What I don't understand is \- unless I've missed the news \- where are the ICJ/ICC on all this? Are they underway drafting a petition for a warrant for all complicit parties \- Trump included, being the trump card and all \- in this administration?

[This Daily Show clip from last night](https://youtu.be/HDSzUfMZRHE?si=RJknTZ32TclQEQ1W) elucidates in the often hilarious way Jon Stewart does how much this parallels and to an extent copies the whole Operation Iraqi Freedom from the early aughts: it's about the oil!

Remember the story about Haitians eating dogs and cats in Ohio? Trump repeated this during a presidential campaign debate before JD Vance goes on meet the press and admits they made it up to get a desired reaction.

These are the people running the country now. And in charge of the military.

The fact that he has a 38% approval rating is genuinely terrifying and is an absolute indictment of the population of the US.

No decent person could approve of Trump at this point.

> 38% approval for leading, but 100% approval for Reddit content entertainment. People mock, hate, do everything but confront media addiction to Fox News HDTV with Jen Senko's nonfiction... and media addiction of Reddit commenting about Trump / MAGA with Neil Postman's nonfiction. Addicts to Trump-junk don't want to admit and go first on the massive USA society-wide addiction to a Reality TV "The Apprentice" superstar / celebrity.

If you looked at what Conservatives were saying on January 6 it was a mix of them blaming the events on ‘ANTIFA’, condemning it, or reacting to it with enthusiasm (really just the QAnon types, most Conservatives fit the first two camps).

Only later, when they got their talking points, did it become a peaceful protest and/or ‘blown out of proportion.’

Just look at Sen. Lindsay Graham’s comments in the immediate aftermath:

> The first thing that stands out to me is how embarrassed and disgusted I am that the United States Capitol could be taken over by domestic terrorists while we're in session, transferring power from one president to the other, that a band of people who are terrorists, not patriots, literally occupied the floor of the House, drove the Senate out of its chamber.

No shit! They had a convention event with a huge banner declaring as much. No body took them seriously. 

How 'bout now?

Fucking idiots. Anyone that did not see this coming down Main St. is a fucking idiot.

They just grab people. In the New Orleans area, they really went after day laborers; they went after the people in Home Depot parking lots, they showed up and took in roofers working on someone's roof, and basically anyone who looked Hispanic. 

They chased a poor woman who was walking home, who is a citizen:

Thank you! I'm so tired of people focusing on one issue at the expense of all the other shit going on. "There was an attempt to distract from the Epstein files by kidnapping a foreign leader"... Right, so we're just giving him a pass for that because we're still hammering on about the Epstein files?

Snark-washing, satire-washing, sarcasm-washing Trump as entertainment. I'm shocked that people think it is actually enjoyable to harm their children and neighbors after we had Carl Sagan's 1995 book. It shocks me every time I paste this quote and people don't front-page it on Reddit every hour and walk away from posting any more:
> 
> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59
> 
> You know what dumb and dumber fans and Hang Hill fans I get on Reddit... they are the only ones to take the quote seriously the last couple years. Instead of saying: wow, this is our problem dumb memes. I've started to say it: Malala has given up. She has, at least for now, forgotten how bad it is being around a community who won't stand up in Pakistan. Or she is burned out, where she doesn't want to look burned out. Knowing people, they would blame the bullet injury instead of the bullshit with Palestine. Why can't Palestine hold her book up and call for no more terrorism world-wide, no more war? Because people think it is funny.
> 
> I've seen so many celebrate ignorance and celebrate harm to Israel. I've seen so many celebrate "Leopards Eating Faces" on Reddit. Oh look, Israel Leopards Eating Faces! Oh look, Palestine terrorists fucked around and found out. IT IS ALL: Celebration of Ignorance. And it **still fucking shocks me and damages my brain** every time I know it is real reality that people think it is funny when parents fight child custody battles and nations team-sport for hate. Earth Pride, Pale Blue Dot Pride, is in the toilet!

Post Title:      We’re the Bad Guys Now  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
When you have a nation with this unhealthy, over\-the\-top patriotism, where they see themselves as almost divinely chosen, a shining beacon, the biggest, the best, blah blah blah, mixed with insane inequality, a downright inhumane system, and a weird obsession with guns, it’s a recipe for disaster. America is full of decent people, but it’s never really figured out how to build a decent society.

From a global perspective, the big decay of the U.S. began in 2001\. What is happening now is the result of a series of events that have already taken place. Nothing occurs in a vacuum. Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 after witnessing the U.S. carry out a similar action in Iraq just a few years earlier. The war in Ukraine can be seen as an escalation of that dynamic. Now the U.S. is going full bunker mode, taking whatever it believes is theirs. The significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It marked the beginning of internal unrest that gradually spilled out into the world. It also represented the peak of American power.

The immediate terror and shock from the attacks were significant, but they were not the main or lasting effect. The long\-term consequences, including political division, mistrust, and societal polarization, came from how society responded, from the decisions we made, the leaders we elected, and the conflicts we allowed to grow. Osama Bin Laden’s broader goal was not just to kill people, but to weaken the U.S. internally by creating division, chaos, and loss of trust. In a sense, society unintentionally helped achieve that goal through its own actions after the attacks.

In the end, Bin Laden won.

Post Title:      Iran facing it’s biggest protest in three years  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
It’s the result of decades of authoritarian rule where people have no real political voice, elections are tightly controled and dissent is criminalized.

The protests were reignited after the death of Mahsa Amini, which became a breaking point for many, especially women, after years of aggressive enforcement of mandatory hijab laws and daily state control over personal life. Many young people are sick of hard line Islamic laws restricting every facet of their lives as well these hardliners insisting on constantly engaging in a forever war with Israel and simply want peace. They’re also running into a historic water shortage after years of warning from experts and the government failing to act in any meaningful way and instead they just poured much needed money into proxy wars with terrorist groups like Hezbollah, houthis and Hamas. Add that to the fact that those same proxy groups and Iran itself got humiliated in its recent war with Israel and those desperately needed funds now seem that they were all but thrown away. 

Add an economy in free fall. Extreme inflation has gripped the country with the Iranian rial sinking in value by 55% in value this year alone. Then there’s unemployment, corruption, sanctions pressure, and then the state response: arrests, torture, executions, and lethal force. That cycle convinces more people the system can’t fix problems, it can only suppress them.

At its core, this is a generational uprising. Young Iranians are openly rejecting clerical rule and demanding basic freedoms, dignity, and a future they can actually choose.

The protests have now spread to every major city and are continuing to grow even in many smaller ones. What’s interesting is that usually the ayatollah would crack down on these protests with extreme violence. People would disappear or be outright killed before any larger protests could take hold. In this case though, the newly elected president (which doesn’t hold even close to as much sway as the ayatollah) has called for a dialogue but it’s tbd if that will hold. Already 34 people have been killed by security forces while protesting. Iran used to be a shining example of freedom in the middle east before the rise of hard right Islamic uprising and many would like to get back to that golden age.

TL;DR: it’s people pushing back against a system that governs through fear instead of consent and a government that failed to provide basic services the country desperately needs.

Edit: here we go. sad news this morning. Iranian Authorities are now intensifying crackdown on protests with live fire, arbitrary arrests, removal of internet services and attacks on Hospitals: [https://iranhumanrights.org/2026/01/iranian\-authorities\-intensify\-crackdown\-on\-protests\-with\-live\-fire\-arbitrary\-arrests\-and\-attacks\-on\-hospitals/](https://iranhumanrights.org/2026/01/iranian-authorities-intensify-crackdown-on-protests-with-live-fire-arbitrary-arrests-and-attacks-on-hospitals/)

I’ve noticed this switch on social media \- all of a sudden they’re cheering on US imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine in particular. It’s not just bots either \- real people are doing it too, like MAGA influencers with large follower counts. They’ve obviously decided to push this propaganda to make starting wars more palatable to the MAGA crowd, perhaps because they’re going to need military recruits and the dumbest part of the population not joining with the left in condemning Trump’s war\-mongering.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Jeffery Epstein called Trump “Functionally illiterate.”

Trump can barely read, but he has a system and it requires total fealty. He gets that by elevating people to positions that they have no business holding.

Examples: Pete Hegseth, RFK, Dr. Oz, Pam Bondi, Karoline Leavitt, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, Big Balls

That’s why Bolton is out of the White House and that’s why Trump wants to work with members of the very same regime in Venezuela that he took military action against.

February 17, 2025 https://old.reddit.com/r/RescueFriends/ - Putin has mind-fucked rural population and Donald Trump and mind-fucked Fox News audience into self-harm of humanity. Surkov won since March 2013.

Who would have thought the hero of blue collar, Christian America would be a thrice divorced serial adulterer who spent decades palling around with a child sex trafficker, plates everything he owns in gold, and holds the Bible upside down when he tries to act like he’s familiar with it.

> Reddit society top upvoted comment on page. Satire-washing, sane-washing, comedy-washing, sarcasm-washing Trump as entertainment. As Reddit customers have been doing since June 16, 2025. Turning everything related to { Trump, MAGA } into entertainment to snark about. Handing power over to Surkov techniques, by playing right into the unreality / fiction tone and mindsets. Neil Postman's 1985 book explains why this is a horrible idea, and why Reddit culture is destroying the nation with "amusement" media.

[Manufactured Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)

**"The political economy of the mass media"** is literally the subtitle. 

For those unaware, the first paragraph of the wiki regarding the book is:

> It argues that the mass communication media of the U.S. "are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system\-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self\-censorship, and without overt coercion", by means of the propaganda model of communication.

Why the hell are those in power so interested buying media companies?

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison bought major US media companies, and Trump even made his own...

This is going to set America back so much for so little short term gains. 

The world will move on developing and producing new clean energy and the US will be sat there burning coal asking if they can buy in come the future.

Who is telling him to do this shit? It has to be Heritage Foundation libertarians because Trump himself wouldn't even come up with these things.

I don't know why it's so hard for some to believe that he's telling himself to do this shit. He's a narcissistic egomaniac with the power to do whatever he wants. So he does. That is the reason for everything he does.

Not money, not racism, not the Epstein files, not dementia, not Putin, or Musk, or Miller whispering in his ear. **Just unchecked power in egomaniacal hands.**

All this shit started with the lead-up to the February 20, 2014 Ukraine invasion / Ukraine war. Self-harm to USA on the world stage and domestic self-harm (Russia domestic self-harm, USA domestic self-harm) is the outcome of the runaway Surkov monomyth meme patterns since March 2013.

The problem is that all the damage that he and this administration are doing is going to take decades to fix, if ever. We have lost so much more than we even understand right now.

That won't be what happens if you allow Trump to stay in office long enough to die of old age. This isn't some children's fantasy novel where the evil man has a heart attack and then all the people are saved before breaking out into a dance party montage as the credits roll. He's old, but old *persists* longer than you think. 

The regime he is building will not allow his name to be "besmirched" \- as they will claim. Heck, just look at how they reacted to Charlie Kirk.

The only way those books are written, or those house parties can happen outside of strict secrecy is if America actually deals with the *entire* Republican dictatorship.
