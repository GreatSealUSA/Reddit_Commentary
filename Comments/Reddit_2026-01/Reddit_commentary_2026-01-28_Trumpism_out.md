I was still a young man, only age 27, I did not comprehend much of what I was witnessing. It was not until I had lived overseas in Arica, Chile ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos_de_Arica ) and had experienced the fandom from a non-USA sport cult systems. It was surreal living there at the time of a Star Wars film release and going to an opening night - and witnessing the hotel an press activities of sports players.

Paul Allen saw computer operating systems of sport fandoms much the same way, and was able to yield wealth and power behind the scenes that could bend any person's childhood symbolism more than any religion clergy. In the 1990' white men were running the world, the computer industry was almost entirely white males from top to bottom. While  I was born in Georgia in the context of Dr. Martin Luther King jr in 1969, I was the only member of my family (who were all born in Ohio, mother / father / both my brothers) to take seriously what Georgia's Jimmy Carter had to say about religion and society operating systems reformations.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Bill Gates could have sent any employee in the entire company over to co-founder buddy Paul Allen's office in November 1995, but Microsoft Consulting sent me. Nobody else wanted to take on an upgrade of pre-release Microsoft Exchange Server social media server upgrade sot production release. And then I was hired as a direct employee of Vulcan Northwest. ANYONE could have been hired for that job, the richest most connected computer people i the world, and they hired an outsider who had never been to Seattle before. I had a background from the IBM OS/2 and Vax/VMS and SAP R/3 Unix side of the industry that almost nobody in the Microsoft Bellevue / Redmond circles had.  I had zero industry insider connections, my father was into Pepsi soda business. Even now in 2026, I still get my mind blown of what I saw in year 1996 from the top of Pal Allen Group HQ. I was on the team to integrate the Seahawks purchase, I went and interviewed the team coach to make sure players were connected with the Wired World via owner private internal social media systems.

Mods removed the last thread because the OP intentionally picked out the worst parts of the quote, and nobody bothered to watch the video to call it out, it's still not a very good quote for someone from Minnesota, but it's definitely MUCH MUCH better than what the other OP made it sound like

Edit: this was the title of the previous thread that got deleted

He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Haha I'm from Glasgow and the two big "soccer teams" here Celtic and Rangers have a fierce and violent rivalry going back 100s of years. When I go abroad to Turkey there is a Celtic themed bar that plays anti Rangers songs and stuff which gets everyone all riled up. All the fans love the Turkish dude who owns the bar thinking he is a hardcore Celtic fan \- little do they know he also owns the rangers bar 10 minutes away doing the exact same thing.

In 2011, he published The Machine and the Giant, a story exploring themes of power and management, followed by the short story Without Sky (2014), a science fiction allegory often cited by Western analysts to explain his "non-linear warfare" strategy.

I think it's fascinating that Nicki was so big and seemed to be everywhere, but once other female artists came up (many due to her influence) she fell from grace by not supporting them. Similar to Trump, if you're not praising her then you're her enemy. But unlike Trump, she goes harder on women than men since she centers her life around them.

We know her brother was convicted of horrific crimes, those she aligned herself with were charged with horrific crimes. She married a man who was also convicted and has made her public life worse. But because she centers men over herself, she doesn't care. Which is crazy to me, because the entertainment business is filled with horrible people, but they're horrible people who put themselves and their career first. The fact that she put her husband's crimes over her career when she's the breadwinner is just wild. 

Now she has no choice but to beg Trump so her husband can get his record clean. It's sad. She's always been a bad person, but throwing away everything for a man who can't even go to the park is insane.

The one and only one motivation, Ignoring brainwashing, ignoring Fox News HDTV cult that does not *give money* to cultists to tune into addictive content. Short Twitter-length Tweet-thinking messaging to manipulate Reddit audience into avoiding the Trump cult stardom-cult "Fauxmoi" behavior of Reddit community. Trump is first and foremost an actor, acting the Tony Clifton SNL NYC performance of Trump family home town. Reddit fandom eats up the show and does not desire to remove Trump from the constant center of all media systems focus.

Entirely unaware that Charlie Kirk has a media cult following, podcast medium cult, and the severe emotional impact of fellow Reddit cultists / media cultists. I call this the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" media crisis; Charlie Kirk in year 2021 created https://PoliticalResearch.org/about/in-the-news/charlie-kirks-turning-point-usa-increasingly-leaning-right-wing-christian the Turning Point USA Faith ("TPUSA Faith") Christian media cult, and Reddit audience member has no education (or perhaps does and has either forgotten or lost comprehension) on comparative mythology. This is why so many Reddit hive-minded individuals can't grasp why Trump has such extreme power over the society using Surkov monomyth screenplay patterns.

Surkov students are running circle around the Reddit audience. "emotionally upset" - Reddit comment, emotional disturbed, Kirk impacted people extremely deep with the White House and Kremlin TCP/IP amplifications and HDTV amplifications. The video of Charlie Kirk's assassination was extremely thrilling to action violence monomyth fandoms.
