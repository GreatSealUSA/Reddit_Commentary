yeah since 2011 they have been pretty open about it.

They used identity politics and gamed both sides of that "culture war" to keep people angry and distracted while they silently undid more regulations.

i will never be able to wrap my head around how us average people are still waging culture wars over meaningless bullshit like gender and race and sexuality while the rich get richer and rob us blind. every election we have the chance to focus on healthcare, infrastructure, education, money in politics, taxing the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, things that *actually* affect all of us. but no, we can't focus on that because instead we need to be arguing about who is sleeping with whom. you've got americans who are terrified to go to the fucking doctor for fear of being in medical debt for the rest of their lives but somehow they can get more riled up and passionate about that new woke show on netflix.

it boggles the mind. and now we have people supporting a billionaire president who have deluded themselves into thinking he's fighting for the common man while literally all he is doing is enriching himself and the other millionaires and billionaires he brought into the government. but doing a good job of keeping you distracted over the meaningless bulllshit.

as long as we keep fighting each other over absolutely irrelevant nonsense, the 1% don't have to do anything at all except sit back and count their money. it just will never end.

> COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING - we have taken free thinking and mythology science fiction understanding for granted. We keep thinking religion conflicts (sconce fiction vs. science fiction, Quran vs. Bible of 9/11, September 11 2001) are behind us. Torah science fiction vs. Quran science fiction fandoms of October 7, 2023 Palestine. We keep ignoring the cult behaviors of science fictions storytelling, Fox News televangelism fiction. Donald Trump does what no other President in USA history does so well: Charming fiction storytelling. Trump creates wild storytelling that USA media consumers flock to, like flies to smelly shit. The abandonment of free-thinking science in favor of fiction storytelling that Trump creates playing the POTUS Tony Clifton fiction character and Surkov student fiction screenplays. Americans eat it up. For all their faults, one thing the Founding Fathers of the USA had was free thinking. FREE_MASONS_FREE_THINKING_SELF_AWARENESS
