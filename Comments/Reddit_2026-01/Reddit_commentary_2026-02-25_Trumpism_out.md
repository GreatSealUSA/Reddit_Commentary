yeah since 2011 they have been pretty open about it.

They used identity politics and gamed both sides of that "culture war" to keep people angry and distracted while they silently undid more regulations.

i will never be able to wrap my head around how us average people are still waging culture wars over meaningless bullshit like gender and race and sexuality while the rich get richer and rob us blind. every election we have the chance to focus on healthcare, infrastructure, education, money in politics, taxing the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, things that *actually* affect all of us. but no, we can't focus on that because instead we need to be arguing about who is sleeping with whom. you've got americans who are terrified to go to the fucking doctor for fear of being in medical debt for the rest of their lives but somehow they can get more riled up and passionate about that new woke show on netflix.

it boggles the mind. and now we have people supporting a billionaire president who have deluded themselves into thinking he's fighting for the common man while literally all he is doing is enriching himself and the other millionaires and billionaires he brought into the government. but doing a good job of keeping you distracted over the meaningless bulllshit.

as long as we keep fighting each other over absolutely irrelevant nonsense, the 1% don't have to do anything at all except sit back and count their money. it just will never end.

Not shocking, though he's mentioned more than anyone else in the files.

ALSO, a reminder on tariffs since it was a highlight of the SOTU address: US citizens and US businesses pay all tariffs imposed by the United States government when foreign goods come into this country. The United States cannot tax other governments.

Nearly 90% of the added cost of tariffs get passed directly to the consumer. Foreign exporters almost never lower their prices as a result of American tariffs.

REDDIT_TOP_COMMENT_YOUNG_ACCOUNT Not even 140 character Tweet-style thinking polarity as programmed into mins by world's most wealthy man and immigrant ladder-puller Elon Musk Twitter owner. Gleeful that the USA population is generating "Trumptard" content for Reddit app. This low-effort banal messaging serves: DEFLECTION_FROM_BILLIONAIRES_AND_PUTINISM Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg have used the most powerful machines ever created on planet Earth to program simplistic simple-think Twitter patterns into Morocco immigrants to North America, and **people on Reddit are cheering on the billionaire success** in mind-fucking everyone in USA into repetitive talking points. This is not resisting in any way shape or form, this is MAGA fandom. Pro-suffering, pro-badness. Anti-goodness. Surkov won since March 2013.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I thought you can't withhold Medicaid funding without going through Congress?! what is going on??

🤬🤯

Has to be illegal asf

Update: I am getting up to speed here.

It looks like feds are accusing MN of medicaid fraud! and withholding the funds , Minnesota is making an administrative appeal, and has said corrective measures were put in place, and that the government is legally deficient in its decision.

Dr. Oz (from daytime talkshows and now the administrator of Medicare and Medicaid???). claims the people of Minnesota won't be hurt by the decision only the current leadership of Minnesota (which I find to be nonsense as this effects volatile health care budgets all over the place) This is on top of the feds wanting to withhold another $2 billion which is also being appealed. 

Fourteen programs, including autism care and non\-medical transports are among the programs viewed as having a high risk of fraud.

Gov Tim Walz admin is said to be getting a statement ready.

I don't know if it's intentional so much as it's ingrained. They (GQP) commit fraud, therefore they assume *everybody* commits fraud, so of course the other side must be committing fraud, too. It's less a calculated move and more ignorance and scumbaggery.

Preaching to the choir unfortunately. The MAGAts hate anyone who disagrees with them. Hopefully the recent polls with 36% support is understated in regard to actual Americans who are full fledge MAGA. Nice to see people speaking up, but its been this way since Day 1 for Trump s second term and he will absolutely push for authoritarian control as long as he can

More people need to point out that Trump acts like a fuckin baby. There's literally nothing controversial about it, everyone knows this.

> CALL_FOR_ACTION_TO_DO_TRIVIAL_CHANGE I'm pointing out the length of this comment. How simplistic. Trump is 79 years old, he is not a baby. Elon Musk is not a baby. Putin is not a baby. What the fuck does it accomplish other than your entertainment to call Trump a baby? You clearly can not face adult mind problems with ADULTS like GenX woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 that is sitting in every public library! This is Reddit comment using Twitter-thinking Tweet-programmed mindsets. Being "a baby" is generally considered innocent and morally uncorrupted, not responsible for crimes. You are baby-washing Trump as innocent of his actions, his PARENTS are responsible for taking care of a baby. Trump has no living parents!

I think everyone who doesn't support Trump needs to stop with these appeals to reason and decency. It's coming across as pathetic conciliatory pleading at this point and nobody on the right gives a shit about it. 

I'm more than happy to be called an "enemy" by Trump and his cult of braindead minions. I am their enemy. That's something to be proud of.

"They're just focusing on the criminals" is what a relative said to me about 6 months back when I told them that I had cancelled plans to drive to the States to see a concert. They thought I was being over the top and alarmist. This dude in the story is White and is a permanent resident of the US, and he still has been in some fucking ICE concentration camp for 4 months, allegedly (the Trump administration's word means nothing) because of charges from like 20 years ago.

If they're locking up White grandmas (another recent story, I believe the woman was British?), nobody is safe.

At this point "I thought they were only taking criminals" is two steps behind. So what if they are taking criminals out not? That's not the false dichotomy narrative anymore. 

Because they've already moved on to killing Americans for exercising constitutionally protected rights.

Considering many of the admins ended up having their info doxxed and they were DHS and NSA .gov email addresses, and epstein himself was linked to the 4chan founder.... I wonder?

/pol pizzagate and QAnnon was a limited hangout operation to muddy the waters should their little honeypot ever become public.

The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: **“Religion is a defense against the experience of God.” The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas**, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).

The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Post Title:      White House circulating blatantly illegal draft emergency order to take control of elections  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Summary:

A draft emergency executive order to declare a national emergency to allow President Donald Trump to take unprecedented control over voting is being circulated by anti\-voting activists who said they are in coordination with the White House, according to a Washington Post report. 

The draft order — which is said to be based on a conspiracy theory that China interfered with the 2020 election — would allow Trump to unilaterally ban mail\-in ballots and voting machines on the basis that they are susceptible to foreign interference. 

But voting rights experts and at least one state election chief said Trump doesn’t have the authority to claim such powers — and any attempt would be blatantly illegal.

I would suggest people use Dr. Bandy X Lee's name and mention it over and over and over when White House / MAGA topics are being discussed. Just a simple like line "Please keep quoting Dr. Band X Lee's books!"

Doing illegal shit is what the GOP does. They are just done hiding it:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84>

The concentration camps are not for immigrants. They faked a migrant insurgency (ms13\) to get you to hand waive away masked paramilitary and concentration camps.

Once they hit a certain capacity the camps are for political opposition, not immigrants.
