yeah since 2011 they have been pretty open about it.

They used identity politics and gamed both sides of that "culture war" to keep people angry and distracted while they silently undid more regulations.

i will never be able to wrap my head around how us average people are still waging culture wars over meaningless bullshit like gender and race and sexuality while the rich get richer and rob us blind. every election we have the chance to focus on healthcare, infrastructure, education, money in politics, taxing the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, things that *actually* affect all of us. but no, we can't focus on that because instead we need to be arguing about who is sleeping with whom. you've got americans who are terrified to go to the fucking doctor for fear of being in medical debt for the rest of their lives but somehow they can get more riled up and passionate about that new woke show on netflix.

it boggles the mind. and now we have people supporting a billionaire president who have deluded themselves into thinking he's fighting for the common man while literally all he is doing is enriching himself and the other millionaires and billionaires he brought into the government. but doing a good job of keeping you distracted over the meaningless bulllshit.

as long as we keep fighting each other over absolutely irrelevant nonsense, the 1% don't have to do anything at all except sit back and count their money. it just will never end.

Not shocking, though he's mentioned more than anyone else in the files.

ALSO, a reminder on tariffs since it was a highlight of the SOTU address: US citizens and US businesses pay all tariffs imposed by the United States government when foreign goods come into this country. The United States cannot tax other governments.

Nearly 90% of the added cost of tariffs get passed directly to the consumer. Foreign exporters almost never lower their prices as a result of American tariffs.
