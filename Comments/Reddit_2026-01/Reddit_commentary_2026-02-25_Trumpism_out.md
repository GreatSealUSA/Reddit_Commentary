yeah since 2011 they have been pretty open about it.

They used identity politics and gamed both sides of that "culture war" to keep people angry and distracted while they silently undid more regulations.

i will never be able to wrap my head around how us average people are still waging culture wars over meaningless bullshit like gender and race and sexuality while the rich get richer and rob us blind. every election we have the chance to focus on healthcare, infrastructure, education, money in politics, taxing the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, things that *actually* affect all of us. but no, we can't focus on that because instead we need to be arguing about who is sleeping with whom. you've got americans who are terrified to go to the fucking doctor for fear of being in medical debt for the rest of their lives but somehow they can get more riled up and passionate about that new woke show on netflix.

it boggles the mind. and now we have people supporting a billionaire president who have deluded themselves into thinking he's fighting for the common man while literally all he is doing is enriching himself and the other millionaires and billionaires he brought into the government. but doing a good job of keeping you distracted over the meaningless bulllshit.

as long as we keep fighting each other over absolutely irrelevant nonsense, the 1% don't have to do anything at all except sit back and count their money. it just will never end.

Not shocking, though he's mentioned more than anyone else in the files.

ALSO, a reminder on tariffs since it was a highlight of the SOTU address: US citizens and US businesses pay all tariffs imposed by the United States government when foreign goods come into this country. The United States cannot tax other governments.

Nearly 90% of the added cost of tariffs get passed directly to the consumer. Foreign exporters almost never lower their prices as a result of American tariffs.

REDDIT_TOP_COMMENT_YOUNG_ACCOUNT Not even 140 character Tweet-style thinking polarity as programmed into mins by world's most wealthy man and immigrant ladder-puller Elon Musk Twitter owner. Gleeful that the USA population is generating "Trumptard" content for Reddit app. This low-effort banal messaging serves: DEFLECTION_FROM_BILLIONAIRES_AND_PUTINISM Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg have used the most powerful machines ever created on planet Earth to program simplistic simple-think Twitter patterns into Morocco immigrants to North America, and **people on Reddit are cheering on the billionaire success** in mind-fucking everyone in USA into repetitive talking points. This is not resisting in any way shape or form, this is MAGA fandom. Pro-suffering, pro-badness. Anti-goodness. Surkov won since March 2013.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I thought you can't withhold Medicaid funding without going through Congress?! what is going on??

🤬🤯

Has to be illegal asf

Update: I am getting up to speed here.

It looks like feds are accusing MN of medicaid fraud! and withholding the funds , Minnesota is making an administrative appeal, and has said corrective measures were put in place, and that the government is legally deficient in its decision.

Dr. Oz (from daytime talkshows and now the administrator of Medicare and Medicaid???). claims the people of Minnesota won't be hurt by the decision only the current leadership of Minnesota (which I find to be nonsense as this effects volatile health care budgets all over the place) This is on top of the feds wanting to withhold another $2 billion which is also being appealed. 

Fourteen programs, including autism care and non\-medical transports are among the programs viewed as having a high risk of fraud.

Gov Tim Walz admin is said to be getting a statement ready.

I don't know if it's intentional so much as it's ingrained. They (GQP) commit fraud, therefore they assume *everybody* commits fraud, so of course the other side must be committing fraud, too. It's less a calculated move and more ignorance and scumbaggery.

Preaching to the choir unfortunately. The MAGAts hate anyone who disagrees with them. Hopefully the recent polls with 36% support is understated in regard to actual Americans who are full fledge MAGA. Nice to see people speaking up, but its been this way since Day 1 for Trump s second term and he will absolutely push for authoritarian control as long as he can

More people need to point out that Trump acts like a fuckin baby. There's literally nothing controversial about it, everyone knows this.

> CALL_FOR_ACTION_TO_DO_TRIVIAL_CHANGE I'm pointing out the length of this comment. How simplistic. Trump is 79 years old, he is not a baby. Elon Musk is not a baby. Putin is not a baby. What the fuck does it accomplish other than your entertainment to call Trump a baby? You clearly can not face adult mind problems with ADULTS like GenX woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 that is sitting in every public library! This is Reddit comment using Twitter-thinking Tweet-programmed mindsets. Being "a baby" is generally considered innocent and morally uncorrupted, not responsible for crimes. You are baby-washing Trump as innocent of his actions, his PARENTS are responsible for taking care of a baby. Trump has no living parents!

I think everyone who doesn't support Trump needs to stop with these appeals to reason and decency. It's coming across as pathetic conciliatory pleading at this point and nobody on the right gives a shit about it. 

I'm more than happy to be called an "enemy" by Trump and his cult of braindead minions. I am their enemy. That's something to be proud of.

"They're just focusing on the criminals" is what a relative said to me about 6 months back when I told them that I had cancelled plans to drive to the States to see a concert. They thought I was being over the top and alarmist. This dude in the story is White and is a permanent resident of the US, and he still has been in some fucking ICE concentration camp for 4 months, allegedly (the Trump administration's word means nothing) because of charges from like 20 years ago.

If they're locking up White grandmas (another recent story, I believe the woman was British?), nobody is safe.

At this point "I thought they were only taking criminals" is two steps behind. So what if they are taking criminals out not? That's not the false dichotomy narrative anymore. 

Because they've already moved on to killing Americans for exercising constitutionally protected rights.

Considering many of the admins ended up having their info doxxed and they were DHS and NSA .gov email addresses, and epstein himself was linked to the 4chan founder.... I wonder?

/pol pizzagate and QAnnon was a limited hangout operation to muddy the waters should their little honeypot ever become public.

The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: **“Religion is a defense against the experience of God.” The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas**, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).

The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Summary:

A draft emergency executive order to declare a national emergency to allow President Donald Trump to take unprecedented control over voting is being circulated by anti\-voting activists who said they are in coordination with the White House, according to a Washington Post report. 

The draft order — which is said to be based on a conspiracy theory that China interfered with the 2020 election — would allow Trump to unilaterally ban mail\-in ballots and voting machines on the basis that they are susceptible to foreign interference. 

But voting rights experts and at least one state election chief said Trump doesn’t have the authority to claim such powers — and any attempt would be blatantly illegal.

The concentration camps are not for immigrants. They faked a migrant insurgency (ms13\) to get you to hand waive away masked paramilitary and concentration camps.

Once they hit a certain capacity the camps are for political opposition, not immigrants.

It does terrify me, but I feel like I am in the minority. Most people seem to just shrug and go about their day, using the same apps and giving money/data to the same companies.

Their apathy just kills me. But great for the shareholders, of course, of course.

There is zero chance that Trump would allow either chamber of Congress to be held by the Democrats. He understands the stakes. If the choice for Trump is either a Democratic controlled House or Senate and throwing the country into a Constitutional crisis over the rejection of elections, we know what he'll choose. November, in many ways, is a final test as to whether we even live in a democracy anymore.

Why are Reddit users NOT promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 leaders since October 3, 2017? ANSWER: hearts and minds are conditioned to self-harm the USA through simplistic symbolic thinking.

He's entitled to have anything he says used against him in a court of law, as well as the right to an attorney. Finding one may be difficult due its habit of making attorneys get attorneys.

The world has descended into madness.

A company worth 15bn, that has 15bn in debt is paying 2\.8bn, so it can buy a company that has 32bn in debt for 111bn which was valued at 82bn just weeks ago, in a deal funded with 60bn in debt. 

So when its done, Paramount will have 15bn and WB 92bn in debt.

The only games and movies coming out of that set up is "Asset strip simulator" and "Closure tycoon business sreeamlining".

There are, and will be a lot of people who are really late to the party in pointing out things like this. It was incredibly obvious to so many of us from the very beginning, although it’s escalated astronomically. Still, anyone who realizes it and points it out especially publicly is a good thing and should be encouraged.

I just watched a great holocaust documentary (the Ken Burns one) I’ve consumed holocaust content for a long time but it just feels a little different now. At the end of the documentary they actually showed a guy on J6 with a black Auschwitz shirt on that said “Auschwitz work sets you free.” He was in the capitol of the United States on J6 trying to overturn the government because of Trump. I’m sure he received a pardon like the rest of them if he was charged. That’s just one small way in which Trump is harming the moral foundations of this country. These are the types of people he has empowered.

> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told staffers late Thursday that he would like the company “try to help de\-escalate things” between rival Anthropic and the Department of Defense.
> 
> “We have long believed that AI should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and that humans should remain in the loop for high\-stakes automated decisions,” Altman wrote in a memo that was viewed by CNBC. “These are our main red lines.”

[Trump admin blacklists Anthropic as AI firm refuses Pentagon demands](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/trump-anthropic-ai-pentagon.html)

Quotes from [Hegseth’s x post](https://x.com/SecWar/status/2027507717469049070):

> I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply\-Chain Risk to National Security. 
> 
> Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.

Quotes from [Anthropic statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war):

> Secretary of War Pete Hegseth shared on X that he is directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk.
> 
> We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.
> 
> No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons. We will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.

And the whole "distraction", no Trump is ENTERTAINING. People knew about Epstein and knew about Trump's aggressive masculine behavior long long before end of February 2026. Trump on November 8, 2013 - was flying on a private jet to Moscow to parade women for men. People like the entertainment, people are attracted to Trump's content and photograph. It's February 28 today, nobody is attracted to MLK Jr's weekend message of February 28, 1954. But people sure activate their touch device to comment about Trump shit.

It is endless and has gone on since June 16, 2015 - endless anti-intellectual mocking. Trump is a source of entertainment and amusement. Neil Postman's 1985 nonfiction book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" explains this high-speed information attitude and behavior crisis.
