He does the same thing every time. 

Here’s a fair deal. Yell about it. Ruin our reputation (even more) for awhile. 

Then “negotiate” the existing deal. 

Claim a win and how strong and great America is. 

Somewhere during this he shits himself and goes on a long truth social rant.

Humanity is fooling itself with the idea that it is fun to hate, enjoyable to wage war, and thrilling to murder and kill in organized military. It is all a massive misunderstanding.

It's weird how much importance yanks give to individuals rather than positions.

Like if a load of official had to step down and be imprisoned it would somehow be the end. The president being locked up would be devastating for some reason, like another person can't just take over these positions.

Reminds me of those American action films where the plot is something like "evil villain has sinister plot that could result in the death of.....dun dun DUUUURRRN!!

He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
> 
> * Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

I am from the Middle East and follow many people on social media. You have no idea how many times I've seen it proposed in 100% seriousness that the reason the Palestinians lost the war was the presence of groups like queers for Palestine.

They believe this made God very angry

I'm pretty sure they hates gays more than child rapists.

I'm pretty sure an adult male raping a young boy is less vile to them than two adult men having a loving relationship. It's that public **relationship** part that really triggers them.

> Instead of sounding alarm bells that we need cult deprogramming and the mass dehumanizing of women and girls is advancing, to get behind Malala's campaigns and support Dr. Bandy X Lee's focus on mental health education - a call to just ignore the problem. Avoiding the problem is not asserting goodness. Men need to be educated why hate of women is bad for the entire planet Earth. Clearly the clergy is teaching toxic values and remedial morality lessons are needed. Malala had excellent writings and teachings to share.

The Iranian regime is complicit in thousands of rapes and the coverup of acts of sexual violence against protestors.

The Iranian regime must fall.

Freedom and Democracy to the people of Iran!

First of all, fuck Trump. But even ignoring the blatant antisemitism, these signs don’t make sense and these girls are brainwashed. They have a high chance of being married by age 14 to a man at least twice their age (I consider this pedophilia and rape too btw) with no agency over their own life until they die. So it’s not like the culture they’re from has any moral high ground.

I think we're more concerned about him being a clear and present danger to his own country and, by extension, the countries that are supposed to be his allies.

> Ok, folks, **let's do the math**. "The world hates him", so Trump leads with hate and the world follows with hate. 8 billion people have adopted hate because of a leader of hate. The KKK, Ku Klux Klan is a hate organization. So, 100.000%, EVERYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD, the entire planet, is following Putin's leadership of hate using Trump as a front-man for Russia.

It's ironic and perverse that "conservatism" actually has no understanding or value of tradition. 

It fundamentally (and, I think, intentionally) misreads history to create a past that never was. It takes modern hatreds, modern fears, modern divisions, and tries to plant their seeds retroactively, as if they always existed and should exist forever into the future.

This whole movement fails to understand what America is and why it is so loved. It is an idea, imperfectly realized, that everyone can belong, everyone can become what they were meant to be, and everyone who wants to take part in this incredible experiment of human flourishing can be American. 

That is the real history of America, and it is the real core of the nation's strength.

It seems, maybe because of the fixation on and mythologizing around "The Founding Fathers" and that sort of thing, that a lot of Americans forget just how young America is compared to other cultures around the world. It kind of creates this idea of American culture being insular and self\-realizing, when in reality a lot of it came from much older cultures.

Russian GDP before war (last remotely believable figure) was $1\.84T, imports exports couple hundred billion. Only about 10\-20B either way with US.

12T deal is so utterly stupid only Trump can claim it with a straight face.

Fascinating math, 12$ trillion deal from Russia with a GDP of 2\.16 trillion annually (and probably even less these next years, considering the circumstances).

Can i get a contact from Trump? I'll offer him a couple of trillions if he can give me a billion.

I suspect the Trump administration is, in no way, helping Ukraine or its people. I more than suspect it, I feel certain about this. What unsavory word is spelled exactly like, "Fascism" but also implies corruption?

All of Ukraine, btw, with all the real estate, and all the minerals, is worth about \~$800 billion, according to the latest estimates I've seen.

It would have been cheaper for Putin to pay every single Ukrainian $240k (pre\-war population about 42 million people, average salary $400\), and to buy country wholesale.

If instead of his angry sharade and spitting on camera he would've just walked out and said 'hey, Ukrainians, I'm giving every single one, including children, $240k, and you become a part of Russia now', somehow I think he would get quite a bit of support \- before Bucha, Hostomel, Izuym and all that.

Instead, he's spending way more now, bribing Trump and trying to hold on to some small chunks of land, instead of whole Ukraine.

Worst leader in history, probably.

Russia knows better than anyone how to manage sociopaths. 

On the other hand the EU is largely decoupling from the US so it will hurt the war effort less when Ukraine says 'no' and agent orange throws a tantrum.

Sadly much of the munitions still come from the US however that's being worked on.

Putin has told Trump to present 12trillion dollars to people as part of the facade of independence.

It gives the simpletons reason to say “he’s not an asset, everything is just transactional to him”

It looks more and more that Brexit was a(nother) Russian psy\-op against the British public. Look at the leaders and where their bankroll came from. 

Must be insanely frustrating for Putin that despite his success the UK has been a major thorn in his side, particularly re Ukraine. 

The US has been a far bigger win for Putin it must be said. 

On the other hand, as an outsider, it does appear that the old EU agreement was not exactly perfect. UK should probably have just done as most other EU nations do and ignore rules they didn't agree with.

European history is history of thousands years of constant war. We have the experience and European union is not perfect but the best thing which ever happened to this continent. Whoever says otherwise is indoctrined by people who are scared of Europe or can't imagine what can happen if we won't stay united. We are like the brothers who constantly fought each other as a kids and now we are in thirties and we understand the connection we have developed through the years.

The reality is a lot of it was Russian propaganda using the good ole divide and conquer tactic. It weakened both the UK and the EU at the same time, albeit the UK was overall the most net\-fucked by it lol. Do people really not realize alliances make us stronger?

Well yes. Brexit was a Russian operation to break up the EU. It was partly successful. They were and are trying to do the same thing to other countries in the EU. At least Britain might be able to say they were able to correct the error, unlike some other fuckin country.

Quick reminder to everyone reading this that we, Canadians, are doing this because our sovereignty was repeatedly put in question. Not because we are retaliating tariffs, it is because our country, it's people, nature and cultures were disrespected many times.

I’m in the UK. Over the years I’ve always wanted to visit the US, do some travelling and see some of the wonderful sights that you have across there. 
The reason I wouldn’t go there currently has nothing to do with any financial implications. I simply would not feel SAFE traveling in the US giving the current circumstances and the leadership that is in place. I hope this changes in the near future for everyone’s sake.

It should be noted that this is not just an act of political boycott. It's an act of self\-preservation because ICE is going absolutely fucking full\-ghestapo nuts on its own population and who the fuck is going to go out of their way to hand those goons some genuine foreigners they can murder? BTW your World Cup is going to be a bloody disaster and MAGA is not going to give a shit.

I havent seen one of these memes since the Fantastic Four movie was in theaters. Im guessing it will rile back up now that Mandolorian and Grogu is coming out soon. 

Chuds and incels got up in arms because Pascal has anxiety issues and seen not only holding the hands of men and women in interviews, but these Chudcells focused on him holding women hands, and accusing him of faking his anxiety to do so, in an attempt to paint him as a creeper/one of them, despite its all above board and with consenting adults.

Brian here.. Most people have to hyperventilate in their cars alone when they have anxiety attacks.. Pedro has been seen putting his hands all over beautiful women (with consent) when he gets his and it riles people up. The meme is just taking that idea to the extreme

when fantastic four was coming out there was a lot of pictures of vanessa kirby and pedro pascal being very touchy and intimate like her stroking the back of his neck, while she is married/dating someone else. this led to people speculating that they were banging but they said its cuz pedro pascal has anxiety and that helps him.

Pedro Pascal is a great man who always speaks up about politics taking the right side of everything.

Since that, there’s a hate campaign against him everywhere, including, Reddit, for the fact that he suffers from social anxiety and he needs to have phsiycal contacts with people, men and women, with things like holding hands. 

Right wingers, bots, incels and Jk Rowling hate him.

Is it just me or is this starting to really spiral into something much bigger? Like I feel like they're trying to prove a point here and I just can't see the situation dying down at all.

I like New Zealand's approach to this. They have a sign at each one\-lane bridge indicating which direction has right of way. The other direction has to yield. In the example below, you have to yield to any oncoming traffic.

Treat it like a stop sign. Short King is not only the asshole for threatening physical violence, but also for not obeying traffic rules... But I'm sure he doesn't think rules apply to him.

People are shot and killed literally *every. single. day.* in the US over the most trivial shit imaginable. Feel free to take the risk if you want. You'd be an idiot though. Let's do a little risk analysis as a thought experiement.

Downside of escalating: low but very real risk of getting shot and killed.

Upside of escalating: absolutely fuck all.

I commented on a similar post, but it got removed, so here it is.

“Using Ukraine’s Delta battlefield\-management system, a group of around 10 Ukrainians mock\-destroyed 17 armored vehicles and conducted dozens of simulated strikes within hours.”

Ukraine has real battlefield experience, and their drone tech is on top. I’d say they are one of our strongest allies, and we should be supporting and learning from them.

A lot of people are honestly just *really stupid* and any time they hear something about more draconic punishments or changes to the justice system to make it more aggressive they simply only think "Yeah, criminals are bad, so that's good" without being able to comprehend anything beyond that. 

Innocent people being possibly convicted of crimes and killed? Doesn't even cross their mind. They just go "Well, that's for criminals."

A big example is when posts about Singaporean criminal law are made. You immediately get tons of people talking about how they love that torture is the punishment for littering, how it would make our streets so much cleaner, etc. What they leave out is that Singapore doesn't even have trial by jury and their criminal justice system is absolute garbage. And it's not like it's hard to connect a couple of simple dots to know that *extremely* draconic punishments aren't exactly very associated with super nice and functional societies and justice systems.

People just want blood and aren't willing to think about it with any level of complexity.

If the Americans want parts for their own jets its smart not to play the same game of chicken as with Canada. 

Block the bridge, get no resources from Canada 

Block the parts, no more parts for you too. 

Thats why it's set up this way, decentralized production. So not a single one has all the cards.

Good on them this is how myths start. This is a modern mythical story . A story of young woman destined to be wed given a gift allowing her to turn into a snake sheds her form and a skin to go and run away with a person she loves.

Post Title:      Irish Citizens tortured by ICE | "detainees gamble on who will take their own life next"  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Transcript:

"I raise the case of Seamus Culleton, the Irish citizen and Kilkenny man who has now spent five months imprisoned in an ICE detention camp in Texas. Yesterday, the country was silenced, listening in as Seamus phoned "Liveline" to speak about his ordeal. Last night, I spoke directly to Seamus's sister Caroline and heard more details about the appalling conditions in which he is detained. There are 72 men packed into a single tent, with filth everywhere and a lack of sanitation, violent guards, alleged strangling, three men dead already, and conditions so brutal that detainees are gambling on who will be the next person to take their own life. They are deprived of fresh air. Seamus has seen the sun only a handful of times in his five months there. He calls it a hell and a concentration camp and he fears for his life.

Seamus is a man who has lived in the US for 17 years. He runs a successful business in Boston and married his American wife, Tiffany Smyth, last April. However, he has now spent more than half of his married life behind barbed wire in this camp. Why? Because he was lifted off the streets by ICE on his way to the shops after he had been kept waiting for his green card following long delays. As Caroline said, it is deeply ironic that one arm of the US Government is processing him for permanent residency while the other has locked him in a cage. To describe his testimony as shocking would be an understatement. It appears beyond doubt to breach American commitments under the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

What is the Irish Government doing about this? On his way to Cabinet today, the Taoiseach told the media his officials had contacted Washington. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has said that consular assistance is being offered, yet I understand that no Government Minister has contacted the family directly. This is an Irish citizen about whose plight the Government has known for some time. Reports of his treatment hit the press days ago with Karlin Lillington's piece in The Irish Times. The Taoiseach must commit now, on the floor of the Dáil, to pulling out every stop and using every diplomatic lever at his disposal to secure Mr. Culleton's release. There can be no delays and no waiting for St. Patrick's Day.

Unfortunately, Mr. Culleton's is not an isolated case. Parliamentary questions from my Labour Party colleague Deputy Duncan Smith reveal that the number of deportations of Irish citizens from the US has quadrupled in a year. We have all read articles about the detention of innocent people like Donna Hughes\-Brown, a grandmother who has lived in the US legally since she was 11 years old. Immigration lawyers in America tell us Irish citizens are watching the news and fearing for their own futures. We do not know if any more Irish citizens have been detained in the same manner as Mr. Culleton. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, says it is fewer than 12\. Is it 10? Is it 11? In five, weeks, the Taoiseach plans to hand a bowl of shamrock to the man responsible for all this. He plans to offer a symbol of friendship to the man who humiliated Ireland on St. Patrick's Day last year when he snubbed the Taoiseach in favour of a photo op with Conor McGregor. The Taoiseach knows the expression, "with friends like these", what will he do today to ensure the release of Seamus Culleton and to ensure the safety of other Irish citizens being detained by ICE or in fear of being detained by it?"

What's happening in these detention centers is beyond horrible.

ICE is purposely using the horrific conditions of these facilities to get people to self deport or commit suicide.

Just look at the reports from people ICE illegally detained and were ordered released by a federal judge. Barely any food and water. No beds. No blankets. No medical care. A single toilet for like 50 people. No showers.

Basically, actual convicted criminals get better treatment.

Let’s be honest, it has always been ok in the US to insult Muslims, as well as Black people, Hispanics, etc. And of course, you would be immediately banned, or even deported, if you criticize Israel or Netanyahu. 

Now, when the US turned into an oligarchy, it is doing the same as Russia in the 2000s and now. It is not a new trend \- they just don’t need to hide it anymore. Both party elites approved this BS. Obama’s boy is now the main dog in ADL, pushing everyone who criticizes Israel and Netanyahu.

The entire thread is a bad joke, people bashing Germany over Patriot missiles they do not produce themselves. 

Instead of putting the blame where it belongs \- namely on the country that *is* producing the patriot missiles and which has cut its aid to Ukraine to zero.

> PROMOTING_IGNORANCE_WORKS_PLAYING_DUMB_MOCKING  And it works. Reddit eats it up. Commenting upon it is not resisting the "playing dumb" that Putin and Trump do. Surkov governing works. And We The People on Reddit eat it up with reacting every time. Decades prove these tactics work. The anti-intellectualism on Reddit commenting, the avoidance of nonfiction books and paper and serious quotes, it works for Trump administration.

Thank you for pointing out that this is based in *Germany* and is a FRACTION of the original cohort. Literally \~2% of the original gifted/non\-gifted cohort. That's really not enough to make any sort of conclusions about.

And the German definition and cutoffs for "liberal" and "conservative" etc vary from American.

There are a lot of Bosnian 1st generation immigrants where I live that arrived here during and after the Yugoslav Wars.

Many were victims. Some fought. Almost every single one of them had lost someone close to them.

I've learned a lot about things like Srebrenica as well as Sarajevo and other things speaking with them over the years.

Probably some of the most depraved shit I have ever heard in my entire life.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I started questioning my quest to erase all signs of aging from my face when I realized I don't, and have never, needed men to be Eternally Youthful to be attractive.

Why doesn't it turn ME on when they go out of their way to stay looking like teenagers? Why am I not eternally attracted to teenage boys and watching "wait until he turns 18!" countdowns for male pop stars? Is it REALLY normal for men to be turned off by all signs of aging, or was I just convinced I needed validation from some of the creepiest (but most vocal) men out there?

Now I prioritize general skin health over trying to fight off all signs of aging. Am I clean, balanced, and hydrated? Then I'm good.

I mean mainstream beauty standards have historically favored signals of youth, such as smooth skin, clear complexion, firm facial structure, full hair and so on because these are traits associated with health and fertility. However modern beauty culture has pushed ideals sometimes into an artificially prepubescent aesthetic such as "baby skin" marketing language, extremely wrinkle\-free, poreless faces, "doll like" small features and infantilizing aesthetics in fashion and behavior. The ideal has been pushed toward an increasingly unreal and age\-minimized version of womanhood that is concerning

Yep. And they will defend it by saying “Well we can’t help it! We’re wired to find youth attractive because of fertility!” If you are attracted to features of a 12 year old and believe women expire after their early 20’s, you aren’t driven by fertility. Women are typically fertile until around 50\. Evolution didn’t wire men to be repulsed by women for the majority of their fertile years. Besides, much of their standards are repulsion of markers OF puberty/fertility onset: body hair, cellulite, increased body fat, heavier breasts, etc. The emphasis on hairless, “perky”, “tight”, bodies with as low body fat as possible is not conducive to fertility.

Quite often this very sub is boosting up this ideology. It can get very toxic.

We are all grown women and trying to look like your in your early twenties does not work.

Personally, why would I want to look young, when young women are so desired you have to deal with unwanted attention all the time instead of being taken seriously.

The absurdity of the kremlin toadie's propaganda breaks all the records the closer the elections come. Unfortunately, many morons will buy into this nonsense.

Also, it's rich of them using the nazi\-esque visual allegory, considering on whose side Hungary was in WW2\.

Alternative headline: Israeli government installed security system in apartment where Israeli Prime Minister lived. 

I guess that headline wouldn’t have gotten as many clicks.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

A lot of times I think a poster is 100% farming but then I'll check their history and the evidence of that behavior is not there. I think a lot of people just don't understand humor very well.

> * Joseph Campbell has been challenged a couple times about "myths" nonfiction teachings. I've documented them on Wikipedia (I created the Errata section). Power of Myth book, year 1988:
> * * "There is a ritual associated with the men’s societies in New Guinea that actually enacts the planting-society myth of death, resurrection, and cannibalistic consumption. There is a sacred field with drums going, and chants going, and then pauses. This goes on for four or five days, on and on. Rituals are boring, you know, they just wear you out, and then you break through to something else.
> At last comes the great moment. There has been a celebration of real sexual orgy, the breaking of all rules. The **young boys** who are being initiated into manhood"
> * * "And when the last boy is with her in full embrace, the supports are withdrawn, the logs drop, and the couple is killed. There is the union of male and female again, as they were in the beginning, before the separation took place. There is the union of begetting and death. They are both the same thing. Then the **little couple is pulled out and roasted and eaten** that very evening. The ritual is the repetition of the original act of the killing of a god followed by the coming of food from the dead savior. In the sacrifice of the Mass, you are taught that this is the body and blood of the Savior. You take it to you, and you turn inward, and there he works within you."

Correct, it was dumb. However:

* it doesn't justify the way in which they handle tourists, even with an expired visa
* it certainly doesn't justify the way in which tourists have been treated in the past, including a German woman who spent 8 days in solitary confinement in a detention centre

However stupid people may be, there are minimum standards on how we expect a first world country to treat people, nevermind tourists. The US is very far off

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

My wife and I were talking about this yesterday.

Blacks and Latinos in America have actual culture that they created here to deal with the systemic oppression they faced. They built a culture. White people in the US don’t really have that. Sure, Italian, Jewish, and Irish families sometimes have their own, but all of those groups were once also oppressed, forcing them to create their own identity in a country that hated them.

So how do the Iranian people actually use the Rials. Do they basically just use MegaRials and GigaRials in day\-to\-day? Because surely it must get annoying a.f. to always have to count in multiples of millions for buying bread or somesuch

It’s hybrid warfare performed by Trump against an ally. 

America, your president has betrayed your allies. We don’t need to agree on everything, but think what this will do for you in the long run.

lol none of this is true

Rupert Lowe had already been kicked out of Reform, a few more councillors on the far\-right have now joined Lowe's new party. It's barely a split. 

And no, Reform's ratings are not "plummeting". They've declined somewhat in the past month but they still have [a very comfortable lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election)

You're making out like they're in free fall when in actually they're still predicted to win the next election.

Very well said with his allocated time, I must say.

I find it hilarious when Musk is saying the UK will soon delve into civil war and that free speech doesn't exist here while you have Trump saying some channels are fake news, should be banned and that reporters are stupid.

**To answer the question**

Yes, many of us are aware of Farages allegiances but I wouldn't say it's common knowledge. Papers recently said that Farage's 'stop working from home' speech is probably due to his backers owning a lot of commercial real estate.

However we're starting to slowly adopt the identity politics of America where people don't care and Farage has done so much controversial stuff that it doesn't even matter anymore, much like Trump.

I wonder if its a difference in translation. El Mencho "fall" sounds wierd. Demise sounds better to descibe what happened. Makes "El Mencho" sound like it was some fuckin Mexico's Minas Tirath that got destroyed.

I’m in Puerto Vallarta for a friend’s wedding and the cartel are retaliating by burning buses and taxis in the street. The whole city is covered in smoke, the airport is shut down, we are being told to stay in the resort. I sure do love living in interesting times.

This is incredibly huge and incredibly scary.

Theres retaliation car and business burning all over Jalisco, there are rumors that they will start killing civilians soon. Apparently there are threats to shoot anyone on the streets at 1 or 2 pm.

Glad this scumbag is dead and may he rot in hell. It is just unfortunate that the people who live in the region where his cartel has influence him are currently being terrorized by his lackies, it is currently chaos from what I am hearing. I have extended family members in that region and worry for them.

This dude has been notorious for a very long time. He basically ran the cartels by being the “head operations” and logistics for decades but with his own cartel in some agreement with other ones. It’s amazing how long this dude stayed alive given how much was on his head. 

If you started reading about any cartels in the 2010’s you would quickly find his name. He was pretty mysterious for a long time until his cartel expanded operations after others fell. Seemed untouchable. Fuck this asshole.

I’ve lived in Guadalajara for years, we are also “under siege,” as are several other states in the region. We are currently under a statewide lockdown order, and all businesses and schools are required to close until the violence passes. 

Cartel retaliation like this is *heavily* unprecedented.

The army is going around shutting down businesses and telling people to stay inside, and CRNJ has reportedly said they will start shooting anyone still on the streets ~~past 1pm~~ (edit: which has passed). Shit is going to get very, very ugly.

The Mexican government just got to go scorched earth or this cycle will continue for a century.

Some short term violence is better than an endless cycle.

They tolerate it. Went through McAllen Tx to Mexico years ago. It was so quiet it was eerie. Mexican counterpart tried to call me at 5AM to tell me not to come due to a cartel member being killed. Coworker and I crossed unknowingly. When we showed up to the plant we were getting hustled in. Turns out rival gangs were driving around shooting at each other and throwing grenades. And shit We had to shelter in place until dark. Someone led the way while we made the 30 minute drive out. All day the Mexican team members were tracking where the shooting and grenades were going off. We were in a window office facing the road. One Tacoma with 5 guys with rifles passed and we noped out to that. Most of the plant was watching on FB and laughing about it. My coworker was younger and scared shitless. Once we got escorted back across the border he said never fucking again. It was just shocking everyone acted like it was normal.

All these posts and no explanation. So the government murked CJNG's leader and the foot soldiers and immediate chain of command is having a fit and started blasting at the giv armed forces in Guadalajara, I hear they even evacuated the airport. There is a power vacuum right now, so I'd expect this to get uglier than better.

I know it sucks but the fact that when they killed him this is what happened shows how bad the cartel’s have infiltrated your country. Like paraneoplastic syndrome when your body is attacking cancer. I hope you and yours make it through this and when your country comes out the other side the cartels are greatly degraded!

Fortunately the airport at Guadalajara wasn't stormed, passengers in the terminal were reacting to something that happened nearby. 

Unfortunately this happens at times in Mexico when the government takes action against the narcos. If Americans want this shit to stop, stop buying street drugs from fucking mopes in parking lots: that money you give to the dealer goes in the pockets of psychopaths south of the border that terrorize innocent people

South Park can fuck right off. In 2016 they did a whole season about how the US election was Turdburger vs Shit Sandwich, as if Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were indistinguishable from one another. This did real damage. They even tried to backtrack it and had the Trump stand in character at the end of the season basically say “whoa you can’t actually vote for me.“ Too little too late.

And then there’s man bear pig, which convinced a bunch of people at climate change isn’t real.

Little things too. A lot of people seem to hate Bono specifically because South Park made fun of him. I’m not saying you have to like Bono. But South Park made it cool to hate on Bono, and the world is now full of people who think he sucks even though they know nothing about him beyond that one South Park episode.

“I believe that Putin has already started it. The question is how much territory he will be able to seize and how to stop him… Russia wants to impose on the world a different way of life and change the lives people have chosen for themselves.”

Zelensky is right. This doesn’t end with Ukraine.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
For the people in this comment section that argue "I'm not fighting in the war yet so no". Look at history, for example WW2

When were you able to call it WW2? When Japan invaded China in 1937? The invasion of Poland by Germany and Russia? When France launched the tiny counter invasion? When Germany invaded Denmark or Normway? Or Belgium, the Netherlands and France?

Such wars don't suddenly involve everyone at once. They gradually build up until seemingly the whole world gets dragged into it. And even then, not all countries get dragged into it. Like Spain didn't directly get involved (but did provide support and a "volunteer army").

So Zelensky is saying that the current war in the future could be seen as part of a future WW3\. This current war might just be the start of a domino effect

it's because when russia is in danger of losing massive amounts of face they always choose the "belligerent moron" option to escalate things to take the focus off of whatever stupid catastrophe befell their leadership.

Doesn’t mean they could win ww3, but you don’t have to win in order to start it.

I remember pointing it out that this would lead to countless deaths to maga people I was drifting away from and they said "usaid is just a scam no one will be hurt " I'm sure if I showed him this he'd say it's a lie. But I had to say a big fuck off to all those people maga is a cult of fools supporting a child rapist and I won't commune with them anymore at least not willingly.

Sticking your head in the sand an letting Putin create cults with the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency is letting an enemy nation win hearts and minds without any resistance. Why are serious nonfiction books on mental health not being quoted, linked, repeated over and over on social media? Why is there so much anti-intellectual commenting that avoids adult education and topics with nonfiction references. ANSWER: Reddit is a cult of mocking the MAGA cults. It is media cult vs. media cult. Avoiding Jen Senko's brainwashing film since year 2015 - why are people not linking it and citing it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad

Davidson has Tourette’s and his symptoms include "tics and uncontrollable outbursts, often involving cursing". Davidson reportedly chose to leave the ceremony after the incident.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I left a comment there but it will probably fall on deaf ears.

There is zero empathy from a majority of the posters on that sub for MBJ or Delroy Lindo over there.

I feel terrible for John Davidson that he has Tourette’s and has the type where he can’t control what he says. But Black people should not have to stand there and be racially abused because the person screaming at them has a disability. They have someone screaming racial slurs at them while they are trying to give out an award and they have to remain composed.

They’re doubling down on the tourettes sub, most of them defensively claiming no apology should be given.

I’m disabled and sometimes I need to use a wheelchair. If I ever accidentally rolled over someone’s foot and hurt them while using my wheelchair, **I would wholeheartedly apologize**. It wouldn’t matter that it was an accident, or that I didn’t purposely do it. What would matter is the hurt I had caused.

It takes decency and compassion to acknowledge causing harm, whether the harm was intentional or not, and to apologize to the person or people you’ve harmed. I guess we’ll find out if John Davidson has any.
