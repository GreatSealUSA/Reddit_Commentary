He does the same thing every time. 

Here’s a fair deal. Yell about it. Ruin our reputation (even more) for awhile. 

Then “negotiate” the existing deal. 

Claim a win and how strong and great America is. 

Somewhere during this he shits himself and goes on a long truth social rant.

Humanity is fooling itself with the idea that it is fun to hate, enjoyable to wage war, and thrilling to murder and kill in organized military. It is all a massive misunderstanding.

It's weird how much importance yanks give to individuals rather than positions.

Like if a load of official had to step down and be imprisoned it would somehow be the end. The president being locked up would be devastating for some reason, like another person can't just take over these positions.

Reminds me of those American action films where the plot is something like "evil villain has sinister plot that could result in the death of.....dun dun DUUUURRRN!!

He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
> 
> * Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

I am from the Middle East and follow many people on social media. You have no idea how many times I've seen it proposed in 100% seriousness that the reason the Palestinians lost the war was the presence of groups like queers for Palestine.

They believe this made God very angry

I'm pretty sure they hates gays more than child rapists.

I'm pretty sure an adult male raping a young boy is less vile to them than two adult men having a loving relationship. It's that public **relationship** part that really triggers them.

> Instead of sounding alarm bells that we need cult deprogramming and the mass dehumanizing of women and girls is advancing, to get behind Malala's campaigns and support Dr. Bandy X Lee's focus on mental health education - a call to just ignore the problem. Avoiding the problem is not asserting goodness. Men need to be educated why hate of women is bad for the entire planet Earth. Clearly the clergy is teaching toxic values and remedial morality lessons are needed. Malala had excellent writings and teachings to share.

The Iranian regime is complicit in thousands of rapes and the coverup of acts of sexual violence against protestors.

The Iranian regime must fall.

Freedom and Democracy to the people of Iran!

First of all, fuck Trump. But even ignoring the blatant antisemitism, these signs don’t make sense and these girls are brainwashed. They have a high chance of being married by age 14 to a man at least twice their age (I consider this pedophilia and rape too btw) with no agency over their own life until they die. So it’s not like the culture they’re from has any moral high ground.

I think we're more concerned about him being a clear and present danger to his own country and, by extension, the countries that are supposed to be his allies. 

Would be very happy to see you fix whatever the hell it was that brought this monstrosity to power.

The KKK, Ku Klux Klan is a hate organization. So, 100.000%, EVERYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD, the entire planet, is following Putin's leadership of hate using Trump as a front-man for Russia.

It's ironic and perverse that "conservatism" actually has no understanding or value of tradition. 

It fundamentally (and, I think, intentionally) misreads history to create a past that never was. It takes modern hatreds, modern fears, modern divisions, and tries to plant their seeds retroactively, as if they always existed and should exist forever into the future.

This whole movement fails to understand what America is and why it is so loved. It is an idea, imperfectly realized, that everyone can belong, everyone can become what they were meant to be, and everyone who wants to take part in this incredible experiment of human flourishing can be American. 

That is the real history of America, and it is the real core of the nation's strength.

It seems, maybe because of the fixation on and mythologizing around "The Founding Fathers" and that sort of thing, that a lot of Americans forget just how young America is compared to other cultures around the world. It kind of creates this idea of American culture being insular and self\-realizing, when in reality a lot of it came from much older cultures.

Russian GDP before war (last remotely believable figure) was $1\.84T, imports exports couple hundred billion. Only about 10\-20B either way with US.

12T deal is so utterly stupid only Trump can claim it with a straight face.

Post Title:      Russia confirms $12 trillion pitch to Trump tied to Ukraine deal  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Fascinating math, 12$ trillion deal from Russia with a GDP of 2\.16 trillion annually (and probably even less these next years, considering the circumstances).

Can i get a contact from Trump? I'll offer him a couple of trillions if he can give me a billion.

I suspect the Trump administration is, in no way, helping Ukraine or its people. I more than suspect it, I feel certain about this. What unsavory word is spelled exactly like, "Fascism" but also implies corruption?

All of Ukraine, btw, with all the real estate, and all the minerals, is worth about \~$800 billion, according to the latest estimates I've seen.

It would have been cheaper for Putin to pay every single Ukrainian $240k (pre\-war population about 42 million people, average salary $400\), and to buy country wholesale.

If instead of his angry sharade and spitting on camera he would've just walked out and said 'hey, Ukrainians, I'm giving every single one, including children, $240k, and you become a part of Russia now', somehow I think he would get quite a bit of support \- before Bucha, Hostomel, Izuym and all that.

Instead, he's spending way more now, bribing Trump and trying to hold on to some small chunks of land, instead of whole Ukraine.

Worst leader in history, probably.

Russia knows better than anyone how to manage sociopaths. 

On the other hand the EU is largely decoupling from the US so it will hurt the war effort less when Ukraine says 'no' and agent orange throws a tantrum.

Sadly much of the munitions still come from the US however that's being worked on.

Putin has told Trump to present 12trillion dollars to people as part of the facade of independence.

It gives the simpletons reason to say “he’s not an asset, everything is just transactional to him”

No, he’s a traitor.

It looks more and more that Brexit was a(nother) Russian psy\-op against the British public. Look at the leaders and where their bankroll came from. 

Must be insanely frustrating for Putin that despite his success the UK has been a major thorn in his side, particularly re Ukraine. 

The US has been a far bigger win for Putin it must be said. 

On the other hand, as an outsider, it does appear that the old EU agreement was not exactly perfect. UK should probably have just done as most other EU nations do and ignore rules they didn't agree with.

European history is history of thousands years of constant war. We have the experience and European union is not perfect but the best thing which ever happened to this continent. Whoever says otherwise is indoctrined by people who are scared of Europe or can't imagine what can happen if we won't stay united. We are like the brothers who constantly fought each other as a kids and now we are in thirties and we understand the connection we have developed through the years.

The reality is a lot of it was Russian propaganda using the good ole divide and conquer tactic. It weakened both the UK and the EU at the same time, albeit the UK was overall the most net\-fucked by it lol. Do people really not realize alliances make us stronger?

Well yes. Brexit was a Russian operation to break up the EU. It was partly successful. They were and are trying to do the same thing to other countries in the EU. At least Britain might be able to say they were able to correct the error, unlike some other fuckin country.

Quick reminder to everyone reading this that we, Canadians, are doing this because our sovereignty was repeatedly put in question. Not because we are retaliating tariffs, it is because our country, it's people, nature and cultures were disrespected many times.

I’m in the UK. Over the years I’ve always wanted to visit the US, do some travelling and see some of the wonderful sights that you have across there. 
The reason I wouldn’t go there currently has nothing to do with any financial implications. I simply would not feel SAFE traveling in the US giving the current circumstances and the leadership that is in place. I hope this changes in the near future for everyone’s sake.

It should be noted that this is not just an act of political boycott. It's an act of self\-preservation because ICE is going absolutely fucking full\-ghestapo nuts on its own population and who the fuck is going to go out of their way to hand those goons some genuine foreigners they can murder? BTW your World Cup is going to be a bloody disaster and MAGA is not going to give a shit.

I havent seen one of these memes since the Fantastic Four movie was in theaters. Im guessing it will rile back up now that Mandolorian and Grogu is coming out soon. 

Chuds and incels got up in arms because Pascal has anxiety issues and seen not only holding the hands of men and women in interviews, but these Chudcells focused on him holding women hands, and accusing him of faking his anxiety to do so, in an attempt to paint him as a creeper/one of them, despite its all above board and with consenting adults.

Pedro Pascal is known to make physical contact with people when anxious.

This is an exaggeration meme, implying he fucks people around him when anxious.

Brian here.. Most people have to hyperventilate in their cars alone when they have anxiety attacks.. Pedro has been seen putting his hands all over beautiful women (with consent) when he gets his and it riles people up. The meme is just taking that idea to the extreme

when fantastic four was coming out there was a lot of pictures of vanessa kirby and pedro pascal being very touchy and intimate like her stroking the back of his neck, while she is married/dating someone else. this led to people speculating that they were banging but they said its cuz pedro pascal has anxiety and that helps him.

Pedro Pascal is a great man who always speaks up about politics taking the right side of everything.

Since that, there’s a hate campaign against him everywhere, including, Reddit, for the fact that he suffers from social anxiety and he needs to have phsiycal contacts with people, men and women, with things like holding hands. 

Right wingers, bots, incels and Jk Rowling hate him.

Is it just me or is this starting to really spiral into something much bigger? Like I feel like they're trying to prove a point here and I just can't see the situation dying down at all. We had a whole half hour segment dedicated to finger\-gate on the BBC earlier and they were actually taking it pretty seriously.

That said, I'm totally here for it lol 🤙🏻

I like New Zealand's approach to this. They have a sign at each one\-lane bridge indicating which direction has right of way. The other direction has to yield. In the example below, you have to yield to any oncoming traffic.

Treat it like a stop sign. Short King is not only the asshole for threatening physical violence, but also for not obeying traffic rules... But I'm sure he doesn't think rules apply to him.

People are shot and killed literally *every. single. day.* in the US over the most trivial shit imaginable. Feel free to take the risk if you want. You'd be an idiot though. Let's do a little risk analysis as a thought experiement.

Downside of escalating: low but very real risk of getting shot and killed.

Upside of escalating: absolutely fuck all.

I commented on a similar post, but it got removed, so here it is.

“Using Ukraine’s Delta battlefield\-management system, a group of around 10 Ukrainians mock\-destroyed 17 armored vehicles and conducted dozens of simulated strikes within hours.”

Ukraine has real battlefield experience, and their drone tech is on top. I’d say they are one of our strongest allies, and we should be supporting and learning from them.

A lot of people are honestly just *really stupid* and any time they hear something about more draconic punishments or changes to the justice system to make it more aggressive they simply only think "Yeah, criminals are bad, so that's good" without being able to comprehend anything beyond that. 

Innocent people being possibly convicted of crimes and killed? Doesn't even cross their mind. They just go "Well, that's for criminals."

A big example is when posts about Singaporean criminal law are made. You immediately get tons of people talking about how they love that torture is the punishment for littering, how it would make our streets so much cleaner, etc. What they leave out is that Singapore doesn't even have trial by jury and their criminal justice system is absolute garbage. And it's not like it's hard to connect a couple of simple dots to know that *extremely* draconic punishments aren't exactly very associated with super nice and functional societies and justice systems.

People just want blood and aren't willing to think about it with any level of complexity.

If the Americans want parts for their own jets its smart not to play the same game of chicken as with Canada. 

Block the bridge, get no resources from Canada 

Block the parts, no more parts for you too. 

Thats why it's set up this way, decentralized production. So not a single one has all the cards.
