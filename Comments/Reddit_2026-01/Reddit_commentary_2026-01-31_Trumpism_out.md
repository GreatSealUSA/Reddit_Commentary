The fact that we've normalized 5,000% markups on basic healthcare survival.

I work in dental supply. A single porcelain veneer costs about $200 to manufacture. US dentists charge $2,000 for it.

We are being bled dry by 'middlemen' in white coats, and we just accept it as 'the cost of living'. That should be an outrage.

2016 (pre AI) media showed tape of him saying “grab ‘em by the pussy” and “"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?”. He was still elected to his first term. At that point I started to think that it really didn’t matter what he said or did, he would still have the support of a shockingly large number of people. Astounding.

> Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

> *In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

Why don't people sue trump. Like every day, for the sh\*t he says about them that simply isn't true and hurts their business? We see monthly headlines of him suing various departments of his own government. And then he constantly lies about people! Sue his ass!

Well…there was his confession that he cheated in the 2024 election!!! The things he accuses others of is ALWAYS a confession. Just like him saying that dems abort babies AFTER 9 MONTHS. His mouth is an open book.

People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center.
