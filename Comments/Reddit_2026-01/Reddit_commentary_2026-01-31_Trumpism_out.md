The fact that we've normalized 5,000% markups on basic healthcare survival.

I work in dental supply. A single porcelain veneer costs about $200 to manufacture. US dentists charge $2,000 for it.

We are being bled dry by 'middlemen' in white coats, and we just accept it as 'the cost of living'. That should be an outrage.

2016 (pre AI) media showed tape of him saying “grab ‘em by the pussy” and “"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?”. He was still elected to his first term. At that point I started to think that it really didn’t matter what he said or did, he would still have the support of a shockingly large number of people. Astounding.

The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations.

> *In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

This article is clickbait to incite outrage from people.

This is the full quote, which is quite reasonable regardless of how the reader views Elon Musk:

“What matters is not release of some subset of the Epstein files, but rather the prosecution of those who committed heinous crimes with Epstein. When there is at least one arrest, some justice will have been done. If not, this is all performative. Nothing but a distraction.”

Their minds are blown into meme-stupor states by high-speed TCP/IP information systems. Russia seeded mind-fuck with the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg in March 2013. People prize the women-domination leadership of Trump. People are following Putin and Trump's leadership since year 2013.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

I have a similar family situation one of my brothers who is a “Florida man”MAGA and a born again Christian (also an alcoholic) he is way into Trump. I no longer go to any functions he’s gonna be at. I don’t invite him to functions. I don’t need that toxic element in my life. It really isn’t about different political platforms. It’s about right and wrong and anybody who goes along with what’s happening has a whole different moral compass than I do and I really don’t want to have anything to do with them, whether their family or not.

I think even saying “I believe she doesn’t believe she’s political” is a stretch. She knows she’s political, her people know she’s political.

This headline makes it sound like Minnesota is rebelling and the administration is just acting normally. So tired of these sanewashing headlines. 

None of this was happening until trump took the reins. This is all on his administration.

This is how the “intellectual maga” wing forms up their arguments. And they have found fertile soil with tropes such as “you won’t have a Country anymore” and that plays DIRECTLY into Replacement Theory.
All the maga Red State folks need for proof of this is that the person on the phone for AOL support sounds Indian, when they order their 3 quarter pounders the Latino is difficult for them to understand and Fox News shows them statistics like “by 2039 whites will be 48% of the population”.
Red State maga views this as an existential battle. As in “we will be in the minority, our kids will be trans and Democrats will never lose an election so we’re toast unless we fight”.

Democrats are fighting this battle for the Bill of Rights and basic human dignity. MANY in the middle are pro deportation but against the Federal government’s violent methods.

So there is enough powerful energies driving both sides\- and both sides think they’re right. Sounds familiar

The Trump administration is weaponizing the government and justice department to target and punish Trump's political enemies.

Does this sound familiar?

That's because Republicans accused Democrats of doing the same, when in reality, they could never tell the difference between "political persecution" and accountability.

They also instinctively assume that any effort to hold Donald Trump or one of their own criminally accountable must be politically motivated and backed, organized and funded by some nefarious, left\-wing enemy and strawman that's hell bent on undermining Trump's reputation or election chances.

Trump and his groveling supporters believe that all investigations into his crimes, his efforts to obstruct justice, or his flagrantly corrupt behavior amount to some kind of "witch hunt." Their cynical rhetoric and their unquestioning defense of Donald Trump suggests that they believe he is incapable of wrongdoing and that he is exempt from the law. In their minds, Trump is the most victimized person on the planet.

"Law and order" has been a conservative dog whistle for decades, and we know that Trump and MAGA don't actually support the rule of law because they stand by the following notion:

> "For my *friends* everything, for my *enemies* the law."

Trump has even admitted as much; claiming he is not beholden to any external moral, ethical or legal standards while posting comments like, "He who saves his country does not violate any law." 

This is a quote often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte insinuating that Trump feels he is entitled to operate outside all laws and regulations whenever and however he pleases. This is dictator logic.

MAGA's law and order rhetoric is intentionally divisive. Trump and his allies use this type of language to incite violence and hostilities towards minorities, immigrants, marginalized segments of our society and anyone who is subjectively deemed a "left wing agitator." 

In other words, to them, "law and order" means punishing your enemies.

MAGA's obsession with crime and punishment is eerily reminiscent of how fascist movements of the past have also relied on "law and order" dictums to torment and crush their enemies.

This obsession is reflected in their support for mobilizing federalized troops and law enforcement to occupy US cities around the country where they are violently cracking down on the opposition and terrorizing the public.

It's reflected in this administration's militarization of domestic policy, in Trump's weaponization of ICE and the DOJ, in his assault on democratic norms, in the Republican party's disregard for the basic constitutional rights of the people they're targeting, arresting, and aggressively detaining.

It's reflected in Trump's continued attacks on law firms and judges, in his defiance of court orders and his flouting of checks and balances, and in his pursuit of vengeance against his critics in the media, his political enemies and anyone who has ever wronged him.

The hypocrisy is baffling. While Trump and his supporters are demanding that he receive a Nobel Prize for his feckless efforts at ending multiple wars (which he hasn't) and "negotiating" an imaginary peace around the world, he is simultaneously waging war against the American people, people he is tasked with protecting. 

Republicans also conveniently overlook that they were leading bogus, partisan investigations into the so\-called "Biden crime family" throughout Biden's presidency, and all while trying to secure blanket immunity for Trump to help him avoid prosecution. He has also directed the DOJ to fire US attorneys and prosecutors who do not toe the line; consolidating prosecutorial power under his administration. 

Meanwhile, Trump and his family have monetized the presidency to the tune of BILLIONS. No other leader in US history has shamelessly profited off of their presidency to the degree that Trump has—no one has ever been so flagrantly and financially corrupt.

Obstruction of justice is a privilege for Donald Trump. His party has helped him repeatedly escape accountability by subverting the court system, establishing blanket immunities for the president, by dismantling oversight and creating a unitary executive beholden to no one. 

Trump has been obstructing and evading justice all through his political career. He's been abusing his wealth, power and privilege to defy the courts and to avoid the legal consequences of his fraudulent behavior and criminal misconduct throughout his entire life.

The guy has even been described as a "libel bully" by the courts and has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases.

Trump has also issued pardons to his corrupt lackeys and co\-conspirators; domestic extremists; drug smugglers; foreign agents; election meddlers and financial frauds; signaling to his supporters and political allies that they can commit crimes with impunity, especially if they donate to his presidency or have knowledge that could implicate him in a scandal or crime.

Trump is not a god. He is not beyond reproach. He is, however, the weakest "strongman" in history; incessantly and publicly agonizing over his "persecution" at the hands of some "deep state" enemy while he abuses his status and the power of the federal government to unfairly prosecute his critics and political foes.

All said, it seems that the party of "personal responsibility" can't seem to take responsibility for a damn thing.

To that point, there's explicit evidence that Tom Homan, Trump's so called "border czar," was caught on audio and video taking a $50,000 bribe in exchange for securing government contracts for undercover agents posing as business men.

Trump's DOJ, which no longer acts independently and now operates as his personal legal arm, refused to release the tapes and almost immediately closed the investigation into the scandal as part of a cover up.

Trump also fired the federal prosecutor who did not initially bring charges against his nemeses like James Comey and Letitia James for lack of evidence, and then he directed his AG on social media to move immediately on prosecuting his political opponents. Trump then deleted the post in question because it was reportedly meant to be sent as a private message to Pam Bondi.

Which begs the question, what other demands is Trump making in private?

Trump is brazenly abusing his executive powers to normalize punishing those who have exposed his criminality and corruption in the past. He has indicated his intentions to weaponize every agency and power of the federal government to seek retribution against his critics, his political opponents, anyone who has ever humiliated him or defeated him and for that matter, anyone who has ever attempted to hold him accountable for *his* crimes.

Has there been any good journalism on how Trump really brings out the absolute worst in people?

I'm from FL and no Bondi fan but I swear she wouldn't have gone this far like 10 years ago. Same with Rubio.

I'm so curious about Trump's process for warping people.

An alleged victim, Sascha Riley, who was trafficked from 6 years old is in the Epstein files and says that when he was sex abused by Trump (after they killed another victim and threatened him) he says he had nothing to lose and wanted to do as much damage as possible so he kicked an object straight into Trump’s anus causing him to be medical airlifted. 

He’s listed as William Riley (Sasha is his middle name) and has corroborated his stories with both medical records and recently Trump’s gastrointestinal doc

It's probably about Epstein Files that were released by DOJ yesterday.

It featured detailed descriptions of what Trump did to children, emails from Bill Gates and Elon Musk and many other pages that people are still reading trough.

The world should be horrified and frightened at America. 

Trump is throwing everything he can at distracting American citizens. Invade Venezuela. Threaten Greenland. Make a "Board of Peace" with some of the most draconian, murderous countries on the planet. Sue the IRS for $20 billion, whole sitting president, over something that didn't happen (release of his taxes). Continually declare "hey Americans, we are gonna give each of you $2k!". We have ICE roaming the streets like a pack of wild dogs randomly pulling citizens from vehicles and kicking in doors. He is essentially doing whatever he can to distract that his is not only named in the Epstein documents of being a pedophile, there have also been much darker accusations of threatening those victims.

This is a mess. Trump is in full gaslighting and distraction mode. Right now, the United States has cut Cuba from fuel sources that keep their infrastructure running and starve them out. I would guess an invasion is not too far off.

We even had one of his congressional sycophants on a news program say he hopes that French and American troops engage in a military battle with each other in Greenland.

As an American, I don't even recognize my country anymore.

> Yes. Look at the forest for the trees. People ADMIRE Trump for his sexual domination of girls and women. People ADMIRE Trump for his health care harm. People ADMIRE Trump for his pandemic pro-Russia stance. See: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - the problem is the CULT BEHAVIOR to rich white men. We The People will not turn to authentic good leaders like Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee, or Malala. Instead, people keep commenting over and over and over and over with spare time and free time about Trump! Trump is an irresistible charm that USA people can not stop fixating on.

Issues are not isolated to just the country you’re in. To anyone saying “dur hur, this is pointless outside of the US”, having a global awareness of oppression leads to more voices and more eyes on the problem. There’s nothing wrong with spreading the word of injustices that need to be dealt with.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Pizzagate was just a cover for Epstein island.


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> Pizzagate was fiction storytelling. USA society since year 2013 has abandoned nonfiction serious learning in favor of fiction storytelling content creators like Elon Musk (Twitter), Donald Trump (Truth Social). The media ecology understandings in the society by students and readers of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman essentially disappeared. Self-awareness to media addiction was left in the past and people are now raging fiction addicts. Fiction sells, so the measure of "good" is that it is popular and draws an audience. Nonfiction **highly relevant** learning from { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, Malala Yousafzai, Peter Pomerantsev, Dr. Bandy X. Lee } have been consistently avoided.

For the thousandth time I say –

Trump is not the problem. The pathetic waste of humanity that is your average Trump voter is our country’s problem. 

Trump just exploited it. With the guardrails off, the next guy doesn’t need Trump’s idiot genius to exploit it.

> Yes. Trump is jut ONE SINGLE PERSON. An entire nation is on smartphones commenting and ReTweeting about garbage information. We are all Fox News trash addicts, Reality TV "The Apprentice". The problem is extremely deep and serious. THIS IS NOT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN OFFICE!!! Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book has been published since October 3, 2017 and available at any university library or public library! But garbage junk commenting addiction has taken over hearts and minds, Surkov won since March 2013.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

I’m glad people are standing up, but goddamn. This kind of political violence has been happening for decades. Ppl talk all this shit when we say Black Lives Matter or mock being woke but look at what needed to happen before ppl started moving. It’s clear who ppl think (even subconsciously) are worthy of life and dignity. I just hope ppl now truly get that no one is free and no one ain’t ever gonna be free until we’re all free.

Trump ran on releasing the Epstein Files.
=========================================

* Epstein mysteriously died while Trump was President.
* 3 Min. of footage from Epsteins death is missing.
* Pam Bondi said the Epstein files were on her desk.
* Trump: "There are no files."
* Trump: "It's a democrat hoax."
* Trump: "The files don't exist."
* Trump: "Obama made it up."
* Mike Johnson: "Trump needs space".
* Democrats voted to release the files, twice.
* **Republicans voted no** on the release **twice.**
* Republicans take a recess to avoid any more votes.
* Trumps personal attorney meets with Maxwell.
* Trump avoids visiting victims.
* Trump wishes child trafficker Ghislaine maxwell, "well".
* Trump: "I never had the privilege" when asked if he had visited the island.
* Trump: "we have the files"
* Trump orders 1,000 FBI agents to review around 100,000 pages of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, and during this process, were instructed to identify any mentions of Donald Trump.
* **When Trump was asked specifically whether Epstein had stolen Giuffre** *(Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent abuse survivors led the charge calling for his arrest. Guiffre, who died by suicide in April, has said she met Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell while she was working at Mar\-a\-Lago as a teenager).* **Trump states:"I think she worked at the spa," Trump said. "I think so. I think that was one of the people. He stole her, and by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever."**
* *Reporter asks tump: Mr. President, you said Jeffrey Epstein was stealing young women from your spa. Did that raise alarm bells for you?” she asked*. **As he tried to listen to the other question, Trump interrupted sharply: “Be quiet!”** **When Collins repeated the question, Trump again replied: “Be quiet!”**
* Joe Rogan, MTG, NIck Fuentes and many more right wing influencers flip and wont back down on epstein files.
* MAGA town halls bringing up Epstein non stop.
* Trump gives Maxwell work release.
* Trump moves Maxwell to minimum security.
* Pam Bondi releases first batch of Epstein files which draw scrutiny due to largely consisting of previously public information and heavy redactions.
* Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law, directing Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release records related to Jeffrey Epstein by a deadline of December 19, 2025\.

This is also what he said about the Mueller report, now what did that say...

> The investigation produced 37 indictments; seven guilty pleas or convictions; and compelling evidence that the president obstructed justice on multiple occasions. Mueller also uncovered and referred 14 criminal matters to other components of the Department of Justice.
> 
> Trump associates repeatedly lied to investigators about their contacts with Russians, and President Trump refused to answer questions about his efforts to impede federal proceedings and influence the testimony of witnesses.  
>  A statement signed by over 1,000 former federal prosecutors concluded that if any other American engaged in the same efforts to impede federal proceedings the way Trump did, they would[likely be indicted](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1)for multiple charges of obstruction of justice.

And it’s built on the real. It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

One of the things I hate the most about Trumpism/MAGA/etc is just how unoriginal and derivative it is. MAGA is just a branding slogan, it really doesn’t mean anything beyond a fuzzy, jingoistic feeling that is really just xenophobia. Trump stole the phrase from Reagan because he knew it would resonate with the silent gen and boomers and evangelicals that would make up his base.

It’s just like Hitchcock playing his audience like a fiddle, and I hate how easy it was for him to dupe everyone just by pushing the racism button.

no, it WAS racism and sexism and homophobia. Now its all of those things condensed into \*Tribalism\* which is so much worse because they have a united banner and name to rally under, and a lack of shame because of the rise of anti\-intellectualism.

It's social media. 

I don't watch Fox news so I could be wrong, but I think they at least try and operate within some semblance of reality, they just warp it to fit their message. 

But social media, specifically Twitter, is just complete and utter untruth everywhere. And it's repeated over and over, and then after a lie is told often enough, it's followed up with "see? Trump was right about everything!"

It's crazy.

When the first amendment was written, they couldn't foresee what social media is doing to us today. I don't know what the answer is, or if there is one, and I'm not saying I'm against free speech, but the way that lies are able to spread so pervasively... We are in a bad place.

No, they hate white Democrats too! They have this weird fixation on punishing the other. They also have a persecution complex. Racism is certainly a large part of it though.

No, it's not racism, it's about money. That's all repubs care about. They don't care about people, living, life, none of it; they don't care if you're white, brown, female, plaid. It's about money. That's it.

They were able to keep the facade going for decades until the inconsistencies of Trump made it clear Republicans don't actually have any principles. Race, religion, and class hierarchies are the real drivers in their ideology and they'll morph whatever they "believe" in as circumstances change

As long as people can take away abortion rights and overturn the separation of church and state and remove all DEI policies Trump with keep on keeping on.

The wealthy 1% and their courtiers the wealthy 9% below them literally have more money than they know what to do with, and so they've decided to buy themselves a planet, and to convince us, the residents of said planet, to enslave ourselves. The Republican Party is merely one conduit through which their money flows. Heritage Foundation, Federalist Society, Cato Institute, and literally hundreds of others are financed by a class of degenerates and pedophiles.

Land of the free.... Lots of comments here about where children should be so as to not be gassed on the streets by authorities. What a strange era to be watching the United States go through. Though I guess they could avoid being shot at schools by not going to school so maybe that's the same line of thought.

I was once at a city Council meeting \-i brought my son\- where a fight broke out and police had to drag people out. I had people asking me why I would bring my son to a city Council meeting. That's the wrong question in my mind. The correct question should be: "why is participating in the public sphere unsafe for anyone?".

Edit: I don't know how awards work but I have two clapping hands things. Before anyone spends money on awards just give it instead to your local civil rights centre, wherever you are, whatever country you're in.

Can someone explain to me why all the conservative bots are on here blaming parents for the tear gas? Parents should be able to bring their kids out in public, which includes a peaceful demonstration and bike ride, without fear that police will use tear gas which is banned by the Geneva Conventions.

"I have talked about how children used to learn morality from their parents and now I think that [morality is learned from] Super Mario Brothers. They spend much more time with Super Mario Brothers and are much more emotionally involved with Nintendo than they are with their aunts, their uncles, their mothers and their fathers. I asked one of my children “Why are you yelling at a machine?” when he began to bang his Nintendo, and he looked at me as though I were a being from another world. And because of that there is a postmodern trajectory. I am from another world. I am still, as it were, caught in the modern. He’s not. Why not be emotional with a machine?

I’m never remotely surprised anymore, but every time I see a story like this (so, daily, at least), I’m still astonished at how utterly complicit Republicans in Congress are in his blatant corruption. I mean, to the degree that words like “complicit” and “blatant” are no longer remotely adequate to convey the scale of it. Thom Tillis is the ***only*** Republican in all of Congress has pushed back at all in anything approaching a meaningful way, and he’s retiring. It’s increasingly clear that the last legitimate US election is in the past, and not the recent past.

Ah, the classic Trump Move:

1. Threaten to sue.
2. Send a strongly worded letter on gold\-embossed stationery.
3. Realize you'd actually have to testify under oath.
4. Quietly let the lawsuit vanish into the same
'investigation' as your secret healthcare plan."

A questionnaire was once sent around one of the high schools in Brooklyn which asked, “What would you like to be?” Two thirds of the students responded, “A celebrity.” They had no notion of having to give of themselves in order to achieve something. MOYERS: Just to be known. CAMPBELL: Just to be known, to have fame—name and fame. It’s too bad.

Funny how he’s threatening to sue for defamation. But in order to win that case he’d have to prove what Noah said about him being on the island is false. So go ahead Donald, make our day.

Lol I just went from watching Justin Bieber giving one of his best live vocal performances to reading Trump tweeting about how he’s mad we figured out he’s a pedophile
