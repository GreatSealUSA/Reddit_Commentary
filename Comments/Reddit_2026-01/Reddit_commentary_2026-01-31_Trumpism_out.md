The fact that we've normalized 5,000% markups on basic healthcare survival.

I work in dental supply. A single porcelain veneer costs about $200 to manufacture. US dentists charge $2,000 for it.

We are being bled dry by 'middlemen' in white coats, and we just accept it as 'the cost of living'. That should be an outrage.

2016 (pre AI) media showed tape of him saying “grab ‘em by the pussy” and “"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?”. He was still elected to his first term. At that point I started to think that it really didn’t matter what he said or did, he would still have the support of a shockingly large number of people. Astounding.

The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations.

> *In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

This article is clickbait to incite outrage from people.

This is the full quote, which is quite reasonable regardless of how the reader views Elon Musk:

“What matters is not release of some subset of the Epstein files, but rather the prosecution of those who committed heinous crimes with Epstein. When there is at least one arrest, some justice will have been done. If not, this is all performative. Nothing but a distraction.”

Their minds are blown into meme-stupor states by high-speed TCP/IP information systems. Russia seeded mind-fuck with the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg in March 2013. People prize the women-domination leadership of Trump. People are following Putin and Trump's leadership since year 2013.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

I have a similar family situation one of my brothers who is a “Florida man”MAGA and a born again Christian (also an alcoholic) he is way into Trump. I no longer go to any functions he’s gonna be at. I don’t invite him to functions. I don’t need that toxic element in my life. It really isn’t about different political platforms. It’s about right and wrong and anybody who goes along with what’s happening has a whole different moral compass than I do and I really don’t want to have anything to do with them, whether their family or not.

I think even saying “I believe she doesn’t believe she’s political” is a stretch. She knows she’s political, her people know she’s political.

This headline makes it sound like Minnesota is rebelling and the administration is just acting normally. So tired of these sanewashing headlines. 

None of this was happening until trump took the reins. This is all on his administration.

This is how the “intellectual maga” wing forms up their arguments. And they have found fertile soil with tropes such as “you won’t have a Country anymore” and that plays DIRECTLY into Replacement Theory.
All the maga Red State folks need for proof of this is that the person on the phone for AOL support sounds Indian, when they order their 3 quarter pounders the Latino is difficult for them to understand and Fox News shows them statistics like “by 2039 whites will be 48% of the population”.
Red State maga views this as an existential battle. As in “we will be in the minority, our kids will be trans and Democrats will never lose an election so we’re toast unless we fight”.

Democrats are fighting this battle for the Bill of Rights and basic human dignity. MANY in the middle are pro deportation but against the Federal government’s violent methods.

So there is enough powerful energies driving both sides\- and both sides think they’re right. Sounds familiar

The Trump administration is weaponizing the government and justice department to target and punish Trump's political enemies.

Does this sound familiar?

That's because Republicans accused Democrats of doing the same, when in reality, they could never tell the difference between "political persecution" and accountability.

They also instinctively assume that any effort to hold Donald Trump or one of their own criminally accountable must be politically motivated and backed, organized and funded by some nefarious, left\-wing enemy and strawman that's hell bent on undermining Trump's reputation or election chances.

Trump and his groveling supporters believe that all investigations into his crimes, his efforts to obstruct justice, or his flagrantly corrupt behavior amount to some kind of "witch hunt." Their cynical rhetoric and their unquestioning defense of Donald Trump suggests that they believe he is incapable of wrongdoing and that he is exempt from the law. In their minds, Trump is the most victimized person on the planet.

"Law and order" has been a conservative dog whistle for decades, and we know that Trump and MAGA don't actually support the rule of law because they stand by the following notion:

> "For my *friends* everything, for my *enemies* the law."

Trump has even admitted as much; claiming he is not beholden to any external moral, ethical or legal standards while posting comments like, "He who saves his country does not violate any law." 

This is a quote often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte insinuating that Trump feels he is entitled to operate outside all laws and regulations whenever and however he pleases. This is dictator logic.

MAGA's law and order rhetoric is intentionally divisive. Trump and his allies use this type of language to incite violence and hostilities towards minorities, immigrants, marginalized segments of our society and anyone who is subjectively deemed a "left wing agitator." 

In other words, to them, "law and order" means punishing your enemies.

MAGA's obsession with crime and punishment is eerily reminiscent of how fascist movements of the past have also relied on "law and order" dictums to torment and crush their enemies.

This obsession is reflected in their support for mobilizing federalized troops and law enforcement to occupy US cities around the country where they are violently cracking down on the opposition and terrorizing the public.

It's reflected in this administration's militarization of domestic policy, in Trump's weaponization of ICE and the DOJ, in his assault on democratic norms, in the Republican party's disregard for the basic constitutional rights of the people they're targeting, arresting, and aggressively detaining.

It's reflected in Trump's continued attacks on law firms and judges, in his defiance of court orders and his flouting of checks and balances, and in his pursuit of vengeance against his critics in the media, his political enemies and anyone who has ever wronged him.

The hypocrisy is baffling. While Trump and his supporters are demanding that he receive a Nobel Prize for his feckless efforts at ending multiple wars (which he hasn't) and "negotiating" an imaginary peace around the world, he is simultaneously waging war against the American people, people he is tasked with protecting. 

Republicans also conveniently overlook that they were leading bogus, partisan investigations into the so\-called "Biden crime family" throughout Biden's presidency, and all while trying to secure blanket immunity for Trump to help him avoid prosecution. He has also directed the DOJ to fire US attorneys and prosecutors who do not toe the line; consolidating prosecutorial power under his administration. 

Meanwhile, Trump and his family have monetized the presidency to the tune of BILLIONS. No other leader in US history has shamelessly profited off of their presidency to the degree that Trump has—no one has ever been so flagrantly and financially corrupt.

Obstruction of justice is a privilege for Donald Trump. His party has helped him repeatedly escape accountability by subverting the court system, establishing blanket immunities for the president, by dismantling oversight and creating a unitary executive beholden to no one. 

Trump has been obstructing and evading justice all through his political career. He's been abusing his wealth, power and privilege to defy the courts and to avoid the legal consequences of his fraudulent behavior and criminal misconduct throughout his entire life.

The guy has even been described as a "libel bully" by the courts and has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases.

Trump has also issued pardons to his corrupt lackeys and co\-conspirators; domestic extremists; drug smugglers; foreign agents; election meddlers and financial frauds; signaling to his supporters and political allies that they can commit crimes with impunity, especially if they donate to his presidency or have knowledge that could implicate him in a scandal or crime.

Trump is not a god. He is not beyond reproach. He is, however, the weakest "strongman" in history; incessantly and publicly agonizing over his "persecution" at the hands of some "deep state" enemy while he abuses his status and the power of the federal government to unfairly prosecute his critics and political foes.

All said, it seems that the party of "personal responsibility" can't seem to take responsibility for a damn thing.

To that point, there's explicit evidence that Tom Homan, Trump's so called "border czar," was caught on audio and video taking a $50,000 bribe in exchange for securing government contracts for undercover agents posing as business men.

Trump's DOJ, which no longer acts independently and now operates as his personal legal arm, refused to release the tapes and almost immediately closed the investigation into the scandal as part of a cover up.

Trump also fired the federal prosecutor who did not initially bring charges against his nemeses like James Comey and Letitia James for lack of evidence, and then he directed his AG on social media to move immediately on prosecuting his political opponents. Trump then deleted the post in question because it was reportedly meant to be sent as a private message to Pam Bondi.

Which begs the question, what other demands is Trump making in private?

Trump is brazenly abusing his executive powers to normalize punishing those who have exposed his criminality and corruption in the past. He has indicated his intentions to weaponize every agency and power of the federal government to seek retribution against his critics, his political opponents, anyone who has ever humiliated him or defeated him and for that matter, anyone who has ever attempted to hold him accountable for *his* crimes.

Has there been any good journalism on how Trump really brings out the absolute worst in people?

I'm from FL and no Bondi fan but I swear she wouldn't have gone this far like 10 years ago. Same with Rubio.

I'm so curious about Trump's process for warping people.

An alleged victim, Sascha Riley, who was trafficked from 6 years old is in the Epstein files and says that when he was sex abused by Trump (after they killed another victim and threatened him) he says he had nothing to lose and wanted to do as much damage as possible so he kicked an object straight into Trump’s anus causing him to be medical airlifted. 

He’s listed as William Riley (Sasha is his middle name) and has corroborated his stories with both medical records and recently Trump’s gastrointestinal doc

It's probably about Epstein Files that were released by DOJ yesterday.

It featured detailed descriptions of what Trump did to children, emails from Bill Gates and Elon Musk and many other pages that people are still reading trough.

The world should be horrified and frightened at America. 

Trump is throwing everything he can at distracting American citizens. Invade Venezuela. Threaten Greenland. Make a "Board of Peace" with some of the most draconian, murderous countries on the planet. Sue the IRS for $20 billion, whole sitting president, over something that didn't happen (release of his taxes). Continually declare "hey Americans, we are gonna give each of you $2k!". We have ICE roaming the streets like a pack of wild dogs randomly pulling citizens from vehicles and kicking in doors. He is essentially doing whatever he can to distract that his is not only named in the Epstein documents of being a pedophile, there have also been much darker accusations of threatening those victims.

This is a mess. Trump is in full gaslighting and distraction mode. Right now, the United States has cut Cuba from fuel sources that keep their infrastructure running and starve them out. I would guess an invasion is not too far off.

We even had one of his congressional sycophants on a news program say he hopes that French and American troops engage in a military battle with each other in Greenland.

As an American, I don't even recognize my country anymore.

> Yes. Look at the forest for the trees. People ADMIRE Trump for his sexual domination of girls and women. People ADMIRE Trump for his health care harm. People ADMIRE Trump for his pandemic pro-Russia stance. See: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - the problem is the CULT BEHAVIOR to rich white men. We The People will not turn to authentic good leaders like Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee, or Malala. Instead, people keep commenting over and over and over and over with spare time and free time about Trump! Trump is an irresistible charm that USA people can not stop fixating on.

Issues are not isolated to just the country you’re in. To anyone saying “dur hur, this is pointless outside of the US”, having a global awareness of oppression leads to more voices and more eyes on the problem. There’s nothing wrong with spreading the word of injustices that need to be dealt with.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Pizzagate was just a cover for Epstein island.


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> Pizzagate was fiction storytelling. USA society since year 2013 has abandoned nonfiction serious learning in favor of fiction storytelling content creators like Elon Musk (Twitter), Donald Trump (Truth Social). The media ecology understandings in the society by students and readers of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman essentially disappeared. Self-awareness to media addiction was left in the past and people are now raging fiction addicts. Fiction sells, so the measure of "good" is that it is popular and draws an audience. Nonfiction **highly relevant** learning from { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, Malala Yousafzai, Peter Pomerantsev, Dr. Bandy X. Lee } have been consistently avoided.

For the thousandth time I say –

Trump is not the problem. The pathetic waste of humanity that is your average Trump voter is our country’s problem. 

Trump just exploited it. With the guardrails off, the next guy doesn’t need Trump’s idiot genius to exploit it.

> Yes. Trump is jut ONE SINGLE PERSON. An entire nation is on smartphones commenting and ReTweeting about garbage information. We are all Fox News trash addicts, Reality TV "The Apprentice". The problem is extremely deep and serious. THIS IS NOT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN OFFICE!!! Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book has been published since October 3, 2017 and available at any university library or public library! But garbage junk commenting addiction has taken over hearts and minds, Surkov won since March 2013.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

I’m glad people are standing up, but goddamn. This kind of political violence has been happening for decades. Ppl talk all this shit when we say Black Lives Matter or mock being woke but look at what needed to happen before ppl started moving. It’s clear who ppl think (even subconsciously) are worthy of life and dignity. I just hope ppl now truly get that no one is free and no one ain’t ever gonna be free until we’re all free.

Trump ran on releasing the Epstein Files.
=========================================

* Epstein mysteriously died while Trump was President.
* 3 Min. of footage from Epsteins death is missing.
* Pam Bondi said the Epstein files were on her desk.
* Trump: "There are no files."
* Trump: "It's a democrat hoax."
* Trump: "The files don't exist."
* Trump: "Obama made it up."
* Mike Johnson: "Trump needs space".
* Democrats voted to release the files, twice.
* **Republicans voted no** on the release **twice.**
* Republicans take a recess to avoid any more votes.
* Trumps personal attorney meets with Maxwell.
* Trump avoids visiting victims.
* Trump wishes child trafficker Ghislaine maxwell, "well".
* Trump: "I never had the privilege" when asked if he had visited the island.
* Trump: "we have the files"
* Trump orders 1,000 FBI agents to review around 100,000 pages of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, and during this process, were instructed to identify any mentions of Donald Trump.
* **When Trump was asked specifically whether Epstein had stolen Giuffre** *(Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent abuse survivors led the charge calling for his arrest. Guiffre, who died by suicide in April, has said she met Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell while she was working at Mar\-a\-Lago as a teenager).* **Trump states:"I think she worked at the spa," Trump said. "I think so. I think that was one of the people. He stole her, and by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever."**
* *Reporter asks tump: Mr. President, you said Jeffrey Epstein was stealing young women from your spa. Did that raise alarm bells for you?” she asked*. **As he tried to listen to the other question, Trump interrupted sharply: “Be quiet!”** **When Collins repeated the question, Trump again replied: “Be quiet!”**
* Joe Rogan, MTG, NIck Fuentes and many more right wing influencers flip and wont back down on epstein files.
* MAGA town halls bringing up Epstein non stop.
* Trump gives Maxwell work release.
* Trump moves Maxwell to minimum security.
* Pam Bondi releases first batch of Epstein files which draw scrutiny due to largely consisting of previously public information and heavy redactions.
* Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law, directing Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release records related to Jeffrey Epstein by a deadline of December 19, 2025\.

This is also what he said about the Mueller report, now what did that say...

> The investigation produced 37 indictments; seven guilty pleas or convictions; and compelling evidence that the president obstructed justice on multiple occasions. Mueller also uncovered and referred 14 criminal matters to other components of the Department of Justice.
> 
> Trump associates repeatedly lied to investigators about their contacts with Russians, and President Trump refused to answer questions about his efforts to impede federal proceedings and influence the testimony of witnesses.  
>  A statement signed by over 1,000 former federal prosecutors concluded that if any other American engaged in the same efforts to impede federal proceedings the way Trump did, they would[likely be indicted](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1)for multiple charges of obstruction of justice.

And it’s built on the real. It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

One of the things I hate the most about Trumpism/MAGA/etc is just how unoriginal and derivative it is. MAGA is just a branding slogan, it really doesn’t mean anything beyond a fuzzy, jingoistic feeling that is really just xenophobia. Trump stole the phrase from Reagan because he knew it would resonate with the silent gen and boomers and evangelicals that would make up his base.

It’s just like Hitchcock playing his audience like a fiddle, and I hate how easy it was for him to dupe everyone just by pushing the racism button.

no, it WAS racism and sexism and homophobia. Now its all of those things condensed into \*Tribalism\* which is so much worse because they have a united banner and name to rally under, and a lack of shame because of the rise of anti\-intellectualism.

It's social media. 

I don't watch Fox news so I could be wrong, but I think they at least try and operate within some semblance of reality, they just warp it to fit their message. 

But social media, specifically Twitter, is just complete and utter untruth everywhere. And it's repeated over and over, and then after a lie is told often enough, it's followed up with "see? Trump was right about everything!"

It's crazy.

When the first amendment was written, they couldn't foresee what social media is doing to us today. I don't know what the answer is, or if there is one, and I'm not saying I'm against free speech, but the way that lies are able to spread so pervasively... We are in a bad place.

No, they hate white Democrats too! They have this weird fixation on punishing the other. They also have a persecution complex. Racism is certainly a large part of it though.

No, it's not racism, it's about money. That's all repubs care about. They don't care about people, living, life, none of it; they don't care if you're white, brown, female, plaid. It's about money. That's it.

They were able to keep the facade going for decades until the inconsistencies of Trump made it clear Republicans don't actually have any principles. Race, religion, and class hierarchies are the real drivers in their ideology and they'll morph whatever they "believe" in as circumstances change

As long as people can take away abortion rights and overturn the separation of church and state and remove all DEI policies Trump with keep on keeping on.

The wealthy 1% and their courtiers the wealthy 9% below them literally have more money than they know what to do with, and so they've decided to buy themselves a planet, and to convince us, the residents of said planet, to enslave ourselves. The Republican Party is merely one conduit through which their money flows. Heritage Foundation, Federalist Society, Cato Institute, and literally hundreds of others are financed by a class of degenerates and pedophiles.

Land of the free.... Lots of comments here about where children should be so as to not be gassed on the streets by authorities. What a strange era to be watching the United States go through. Though I guess they could avoid being shot at schools by not going to school so maybe that's the same line of thought.

I was once at a city Council meeting \-i brought my son\- where a fight broke out and police had to drag people out. I had people asking me why I would bring my son to a city Council meeting. That's the wrong question in my mind. The correct question should be: "why is participating in the public sphere unsafe for anyone?".

Edit: I don't know how awards work but I have two clapping hands things. Before anyone spends money on awards just give it instead to your local civil rights centre, wherever you are, whatever country you're in.

Can someone explain to me why all the conservative bots are on here blaming parents for the tear gas? Parents should be able to bring their kids out in public, which includes a peaceful demonstration and bike ride, without fear that police will use tear gas which is banned by the Geneva Conventions.

"I have talked about how children used to learn morality from their parents and now I think that [morality is learned from] Super Mario Brothers. They spend much more time with Super Mario Brothers and are much more emotionally involved with Nintendo than they are with their aunts, their uncles, their mothers and their fathers. I asked one of my children “Why are you yelling at a machine?” when he began to bang his Nintendo, and he looked at me as though I were a being from another world. And because of that there is a postmodern trajectory. I am from another world. I am still, as it were, caught in the modern. He’s not. Why not be emotional with a machine?

I’m never remotely surprised anymore, but every time I see a story like this (so, daily, at least), I’m still astonished at how utterly complicit Republicans in Congress are in his blatant corruption. I mean, to the degree that words like “complicit” and “blatant” are no longer remotely adequate to convey the scale of it. Thom Tillis is the ***only*** Republican in all of Congress has pushed back at all in anything approaching a meaningful way, and he’s retiring. It’s increasingly clear that the last legitimate US election is in the past, and not the recent past.

Ah, the classic Trump Move:

1. Threaten to sue.
2. Send a strongly worded letter on gold\-embossed stationery.
3. Realize you'd actually have to testify under oath.
4. Quietly let the lawsuit vanish into the same
'investigation' as your secret healthcare plan."

He's a conman. Always has been. His whole history is LITTERED with people who got STIFFED by him.

Look at this 1st term. He delivered NOTHING but trouble. His last phase was the pandemic, which he bungled so badly. Not only did he waste THREE VALUABLE MONTHS railing against COVID19 as some sort of "Democrat hoax," or "China hoax," he had disbanded the White House group responsible for dealing with emergency health issues like viral pandemics. And then he fought against mask wearing, vaccines, testing, and shutdowns. ON TOP OF IT ALL, he did absolutely nothing to protect the supply chain. It was so badly damaged... that the financial debacle seeded inflation that then bloomed when Biden took over... so Republicans blamed it all on Biden. Financial experts weighed in and showed the truth, but Trump and Republicans called them radical left liberals defending the Democrats. 

He's a serial liar. Anyone not in the cult could see it. People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and many others, refused to see or accept the truth. Living in denial was much more comfortable. Well, they need to admit their mistakes and own up to them... but that should not absolve them from being culpable for their contributions to enabling Trump to do what he has done.

I really don't want to watch the interview but I once joked at some point Marge would become "the radical left" because the right had gone further right.

I'm hoping it's a genuine turnaround because people in a cult have to come out some way, and it's just in her personality to be loud about it. I wish I could skip ahead to see if she just becomes Loffler 2\. Ossoff and Warnock are doing you good Georgia. Dont lettem go.

Every woman in Trump’s life\-is a victim of SOMETHING. All the men in the comments making jokes about “sloppy seconds” should remember these girls endured decades of extreme trauma from a very young age at the hands of these men. It’s not funny. Not in any reality would it be funny, but your president is a paedophile rapist who likely did the same shit to his own daughter and seeing you all joking about it makes me realise why he was able to become president of your country in the first place. Smh

Last week there was an excellent video from Technology Connections on YouTube about renewable energy and EVs that made a point: all his videos about how technology works, while not partisian, have been political. Everything is political.

Being a person with empathy toward others who supports discovering the truth and supports the use of renewable energy for common\-sense reasons is inherently political.

Why? Because one party decided they didn't like renewable energy and made it political. One party has declared empathy a sin and truth subjective. So now telling the truth is a political act.

Everything is political.

> * "The work was all about trying to anticipate how people would internalize and then spread cultural information — whether that meant in joining a death cult or in choosing a wardrobe. Bannon immediately grasped all of this, even telling me that he believed, as I do, **that politics and fashion are essentially products of the same phenomenon**. It was obvious that he treated intelligence gathering in a broad and deep way, which is not something I’ve seen many people in politics do. And that’s what makes him so powerful. He reads about **intersectional feminism or the fluidity of identity** not, as I later learned, because he’s open to those ideas but because he wants to invert them — to identify what people attach themselves to and then to weaponize it. What I didn’t know that day was that Bannon wanted to fight a cultural war, and so he had come to the people who specialized in informational weapons to help him build his arsenal." ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 4 "Steve From America", page ??, year 2019

I blame John Roberts. He intentionally made very broad statements, much broader than was required by the facts of the case, regarding the authority of POTUS to direct investigations and prosecutions by DOJ, of which FBI is a part. 

"The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. " Slip opinion at 21\.

We are living in the dystopian, fascist police state that John Roberts wants. Only by removing Roberts via impeachment can we begin to correct the course of SCOTUS and of our country.

He's like a cult deprogrammer in a way. To deprogram someone you need to get them to apply the cult's logic to novel questions without the support of the group think machine.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Talarico is a devout Christian that fights to keep the separation of church and state. He just happens to use scripture to kneecap the positions of Christian nationalists trying to end the separation.

YouTube \- [James Talarico Delivers Sermon on the Separation of Church \& State](https://youtu.be/3E5jjHW6ncc) (24:21\)

YouTube \- [James Talarico Questions Republican Bill Forcing Ten Commandments To Be Displayed In Classrooms](https://youtu.be/we0b04Qbbvc) (2:10\)

“And I say this to you as a fellow Christian. Representative, I know you're a devout Christian, and so am I.

This bill, to me, is not only unconstitutional, it's not only un\-American, I think it is also deeply un\-Christian. And I say that because I believe this bill is idolatrous. I believe it is exclusionary. And I believe it is arrogant. And those three things, in my reading of the Gospel, are diametrically opposed to the teachings of Jesus.

You probably know Matthew 6:5 when Jesus says ‘Don't be like the Hypocrites, who love to pray publicly on street corners. When you pray, go into your room and shut the door, and pray to your father who is in secret.’

A religion that has to force people to put up a poster to prove its legitimacy is a dead religion, and it's not one that I want to be a part of. It's not one that I think I am a part of. 

You know that in Scripture it says ‘faith without works’ is what? Is ‘dead’. My concern is that instead of bringing a bill that will feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, we're instead mandating that people put up a poster. 

And we both follow a teacher, a rabbi, who said don't let the law get in the way of loving your neighbor. Loving your neighbor is the most important law. It is the summation of all the law and all the prophets.

I would submit to you that our neighbor also includes the Hindu student who sits in a classroom, the Buddhist student who sits in a classroom, and an atheist student who sits in a classroom. And my question to you is, does this bill truly love those students?’

Candy Noble (R\-Lucas)
‘I’m going to go in a different direction than I think that you are trying to lead me.’”

YouTube \- [Texas Rep. James Talarico (D): ‘There is nothing Christian about Christian Nationalism.’](https://youtu.be/DlXOjqoylkk) (1:43\)

“Let me be very clear. There is nothing Christian about Christian nationalism.

It is the worship of power \- political power, social power, economic power \- in the name of Christ. And it is a betrayal of Jesus of Nazareth.”

“Christian nationalists like to say that this is a Christian nation. Not only is that historically inaccurate. Not only is that theologically blasphemous, but it’s also just not true.

Look around us. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would forgive student debt. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would guarantee health care to every single person. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would love all of our LGBTQ neighbors. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would make sure that every child in this state and in this country was housed, fed, clothed, educated, and insured. 

If this was truly a Christian nation, we would never make it a Christian nation, because we know the table of fellowship is open to everybody. Including our Buddhist, our Hindu, our Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and atheist neighbors.

Jesus could have started a Christian theocracy. But love would never do that.

The closest thing we have to the kingdom of heaven is a multiracial, multicultural democracy where power is truly shared among all people. Something that is yet to exist in human history.”

James Talarico \- [What would Jesus do if he visited the United States Senate?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/k3V-yjU5WEI) 

“What would Jesus do if he visited the United States Senate? 

I think he would say, ‘Depart from me. For I was hungry and you cut my food assistance. I was sick and you kicked me off Medicaid. I was a stranger and you deported me and my family.’

And then I think he would flip over those fancy desks and demand that we take care of all our neighbors, especially the least of these. 

Matthew 25 \[:31\-46] tells us exactly how we will be judged and how we will be saved. By feeding the hungry, by healing the sick, by welcoming the stranger, by visiting the prisoner.

Nothing about going to church. Nothing about reading the Bible. Nothing about being a Christian. Just helping others. Just loving.”

My unpopular opinion is that atheists and progressives should reclaim the labels of “conservative” and “Christian” from the right wing in America because republicans are so far gone from anything related to conserving anything other than wealth for the ultra wealthy, which is borderline the most unchristianly thing you can do.

I’ve been sending my representatives daily Bible verses via Resistibot. Plenty of verses about how to treat immigrants. 22 in fact. Then, I’ll switch to verses on the poor. The sick. The mild.

I may be atheist, but that doesnt mean I dont respect the teachings of Jesus. Whether you believe he is actually divine or just some dude, he preached some good stuff.

Modern Republicans dont know the first thing about Jesus teachings. They just use his image and name to spread hatred under the guise of religion. Talarico knows the word, practices that word, and knows the importance of separation of church and state. Hes got my utmost respect

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  

> In any case, as I’ve said before, this is why the threat of a not\-weird white Christian who can comfortably speak about his faith without using it as a weapon against the marginalized poses a real challenge to Republicans. They don’t know how to fight someone like him. They can’t resort to Islamophobia or racism. They can’t pretend he’s not Christian (though they’re obviously trying). They can’t understand how someone can quote Scripture to defend the oppressed rather than attack them. They can’t pretend he’s not a decent dude because it’s clear that he is every time he’s on camera.
> 
> Talarico’s theology is dangerous precisely because it’s inclusive. He represents a version of Christianity that actually resonates with millions of Americans who might identify as religious but are sick of the moral rot of right\-wing Christian Nationalism.

Talarico’s ability to communicate inclusive Christianity certainly stresses out his republican peers. There are early signs that some conservative religious voters are willing to vote for him.

Not the Christian nationalists, of course. Those folks will be driven into a frenzy by our Christian nationalist West Texas billionaires’ political machine to vote for their chosen candidate, Paxton.

Texas Monthly \- [The Last Temptation of James Talarico](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/james-talarico-next-great-hope-texas-democrats/)

“Talarico’s blending of faith with progressive politics has made him uniquely loathed by the right. When I asked a Republican legislator who has worked with him what he thought of the candidate and his pastoral affect, the lawmaker called him ‘the most dangerous person in Texas, if not American, politics right now.’”

WSJ \- [A Bible\-Quoting Liberal and a Left\-Wing Antagonist Lead Longshot Bid to Flip Texas](https://archive.ph/Cjpzc)

“Melissa Lee Kovats, a retiree and three\-time Trump voter, had tears in her eyes as she listened to Talarico speak. She had never heard of him until two weeks ago, when her husband sent her a video of him, Kovats said. The self\-described Libertarian said she wasn’t a fan of Democratic policies but had grown disillusioned with Republican rhetoric.

‘The way James talked about Christ and taking care of your neighbor, he took that right out of my heart,’ Kovats said.

She walked out ready to vote in her first Democratic primary.”

NYT \- [A Senate Primary in Texas Tests the Future of Democratic Politics](https://archive.ph/igAlO)

“Howard Harrison, a 70\-year\-old Air Force veteran, watched. He said he hadn’t voted for a Democrat since the 1970s, but that he would back Mr. Talarico. ‘I like his moderation,’ he said.

Caleb Goldstrom, 18, a theology student and Christian who once saw himself as conservative, found himself nodding along as Mr. Talarico spoke.”

ProPublica \- [A Pair of Billionaire Preachers Built the Most Powerful Political Machine in Texas. That’s Just the Start.](https://www.propublica.org/article/tim-dunn-farris-wilks-texas-christian-nationalism-dominionism-elections-voting)

“They control Republican politics in the state.”

“Dunn is also a longtime backer of Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and helped him escape impeachment last year for abuse of public trust and other corruption\-related charges.”

Mediaite \- [Two Texas Billionaires Pushing State to the Far Right Contributed About Two\-Thirds of the Funding for Ted Cruz’s 2016 Super PACs, Reports CNN](https://www.mediaite.com/media/tv/two-texas-billionaires-pushing-state-to-the-far-right-contributed-about-two-thirds-of-the-funding-for-ted-cruzs-2016-superpacs-report/)

“‘There is no Ken Paxton without Tim Dunn, period,’ said Braddock.”

Texas Monthly \- The Billionaire Bully Who Wants to Turn Texas Into a Christian Theocracy ([4 min intro video](https://www.texasmonthly.com/video/tim-dunn-profile-behind-scenes-russell-gold/) \| [Article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/billionaire-tim-dunn-runs-texas/))

“The state’s most powerful figure, Tim Dunn, isn’t an elected official. But behind the scenes, the West Texas oilman is lavishly financing what he regards as a holy war against public education, renewable energy, and non\-Christians.”

“Dunn is up\-front about his desire to use politics to pave the way for a ‘New Earth,’ in which Jesus Christ and his believers will live together.”

“According to Straus insiders, Dunn told him that only Christians should hold leadership positions.”

Wow the direct karma.

They think Brazil sucks in every aspect, US and Europe is the best of all, and they do everything they can to distinguish themselves from other brazilians and south americans, even supporting the deportation of their own people and siding with conservative government stances.

Dumb mother fucker thought they would leave him alone because he is "one of the good ones".

I am so completely sick and fucking tired of the Latino/Hispanic diaspora pretending they are white people or that ACTUAL white people see them as one of their own because of some shared commonality due to Christianity or conservative values. Bitch... they barely care about one another. Why the fuck do you think they are gonna give one flying fuck about you?!?!?!

Especially Puerto Ricans. You dumb fucks don't realize that if you were born on the island that your citizenship can be revoked by an act of congress because it isn't guaranteed by the 14A but instead by the Nationality Act of 1940\.

I like how they unscrupulous posted documents that "unintentionally" hurt the victims by naming them...and waited until the victims demanded the documents be taken down, as an excuse to remove them from the publics scrutiny. Just love evil this administration is. No sincere justice and respect for privacy for the victims, zero accountability for the pedophiles and the people protecting them.

November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow to show girls images across media systems. That's what he does, that's his gift and talents. Getting an audience. Trump is an actor or follows screenplays and performances for cameras. This is all information strip tease from powerful white men to their fandoms.

It is a very sickening society, it make me ill and sick, to see so many people who have never studied or did not comprehend what Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman were teaching and educating the general public about Reddit media systems! The ability to hoard digital data is the message. The Xerox machine, copy machine, is the message. https://youtu.be/2JIj0Bqbdhk?t=321 The Epstein private jet is the message. Compulsive media addict behavior is Trump's force over society. Trump is a camera magnet and the audience is in no way self-aware of the Epstein fixation an Trump fixation via information trickle-down from Trump!

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
So a big question: why is there not more outrage to the consistent barrage of incriminating evidence that is so ubiquitously obvious and in front of the constituency? Why is nothing being done when lawlessness has become the norm? Where are the arrests for treason, fraud and conduct unbecoming? We are no longer a United States. Sad. Just so sad.

i doubt even a majority of Red states would willingly give up their independent elections. 

there is no federal authority to run elections in the constitution. so it would require states to willingly go along with it or a constitutional amendment. the amendment would fail, the states Trump would lose would not go along.

maybe Alabama and Oklahoma

Georgia’s ballot count was overseen by a Republican\-led election board. Brad Raffensberger, a registered Republican was the Secretary of State—and had a background in engineering— and was personally called by Drumpf in that now [legendary coercion call](https://youtu.be/oGbeA7Nrtic) to find the “missing votes”. He made veiled threats to him and his second in command there would be “trouble” for them. 

They just want to appease his ego and doctor the data. I’m sure they’ll have found [11,781 votes, that Dinky Don will have won by just one vote.](https://youtu.be/s1u8F6ERqqE)

I've said it before and I'll say it again \- the fact that multiple MAGA Congress people and senators have significant investments in Palantir should be a five alarm fire.

I'm at the point where I don't even care about "congressional hearings" anymore. It's just never anything more than these people pleading the 5th, claiming they can't recall, or gaslighting those questioning them. There is always zero action coming from them and it's a giant political theatre that does nothing more than piss me off.

I just watched warrants from judges in my state regarding Alex Pretti get spit on by ICE, and not a damn thing came of it. Aside from FBI marching in and arresting those that violate warrants and hearings (fat chance with Patel leading that crew), laws literally do not matter for this admin. They'll likely break the "law" 5,000 times during midterms, but who is going to hold them accountable for it?

The last genuinely great piece of advice Hoe got before he fell from grace (and then Duncan too, forgot his own advice) was when Duncan warned him emphatically that really terrible people would try to use him and his celebrity to spread their darkness in the world. 

But from Hoe's dismissive reaction I think he was already gone.

Why the fuck do you think a comedian as unfucking funny as Joe Rogan become the most powerful podcaster on the planet?

Executive function mind manipulation via Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. All the male-leader Joe Rogan values spelled out December 20, 2013 - https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ - Conservative men ruling women and girls.  - but audiences of Reddit are unable to seriously engage nonfiction learning on Kremlin agenda and techniques.

The Joe Rogan “Experience” is what you have after eating lead paint chips for years.

> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

It’s pretty clear that around half the epstein files are fabricated while the rest can very well be true but it’s straight up impossible to differentiate. Trump was half right about calling it a hoax. If you think it’s all true or 90% is true then you have brain damage.

Joe Rogan is the Jar Jar Binks of the Epstein files. All sorts of crazy stuff happens around him, but he's just so "aw shucks" ignorant that we assume he isn't involved.

On a hopefully unrelated note, this post is better than all the Star Wars movies combined: <https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/>

When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me.

Reddit is completely insane though so it doesn’t matter. The most extreme left wing conspiracy theories are believed and propagated here regardless of likelihood. 

Joe is very clearly not a paedo or creep. He’s far too open and frank in how he presents himself. You can tell he’s just being himself and not hiding anything.

Part of the scientific process is making observations about how things work, forming hypothesis, and then testing them to see if they're correct. There are a lot of things we learn by actually examining things we 'know' from first steps without making assumptions.

Post Title:      New Study Explains Why Listening To Joe Rogan Podcast Is Such a Turn-off for Women  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Rogan is manosphere adjacent. 

The manosphere *hates* women. Both actual living women, and also the ludicrously evil, made\-up version of all women and all womanhood that they constructed, in order to hate women more efficiently. 

Why don't women want to date people who hate them individually, and people like them collectively?

It's almost like women are basically rational human beings who don't seek out needless harm or suffering. 

Science!

Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

Please remember, people who don't recognize obvious meatheads are, themselves, meatheads. Something that really bothers me is that I see the potential someone like Rogan has to change public discourse for the better if the simply decide to do so. No in depth understanding of compassion or humanist realizations needed, just decide. And he could reach exactly the people that reasonable discourse can't penetrate.

This may be an obvious result, but that doesnt mean that the research is useless and that this is just mansplaining something all women already know \- that this is common sense. There's other peices of common sense or conventional wisdom that wouldn't support this conclusion. Opposite attract for instance. 

I think its useful to do science to actually test what appears to be universal experiences in a rigorous way. Now if some podcast bro or someone's brother, Dad, or male friend is going on about how women actually want "alphas" who listen to the Rogan, Tates, ect of the world its easy to point to this as evidence to the contrary.

Also, there are alot of comments here that seem to assume or imply the researchers are men. The three authors, Amie Gordon, Maria Luciani, and Annika From, *appear* to all be women. They probably spent alot of time and effort publishing this. 

I dont seem how tearing down their work does anyone any good.

An addendum to this: a significant proportion of people in this administration in all three branches, corporate leaders, law enforcement, and elsewhere are at significant risk for prison time at best, and some likely worse if, say, classified information is being shared with adversaries. These people are aware of that. They’re also very stupid. But a clown with a flamethrower still has a flamethrower.

Every accusation is a confession. The Heritage Foundation is seriously accusing Netflix of being an evil political brainwashing factory.

The HF needs to be raided and dismantled with all of its members put on trial for treason. Stuff them in an offshore detention center while they wait.

It's not that Netflix is biased (it isn't) it's just that they don't control it

MAGA loves biased media, but only if it promotes MAGA propaganda

It's absolutely hilarious that the right is pushing Netflix as some sort of woke propaganda machine, when they're giving Dave Chappelle $20 million per special (he's made six btw) and he's spent a bunch of them shitting on trans people.

These people are so far detached from reality we're gonna need a new mental illness to diagnose them with.

I always find it funny how the right loves to say that anything that is inclusive, or basically, not coddling to 'their' idealologies a problem. No, YOU are the problem. Because you won't let people just be themselves. You don't like it, go elsewhere and quit trying to shut everyone else down. But of course we know you can't do that because that goes against your very hypocritical nature.

I'm Canadian. Have been studying propaganda for a long time.

The reality is that the military industrial complex conspired with the corporate media giants back in the 80s to take over the Journalism industry and to control youth culture.

MAGA itself is a psyOp started by the corpo\-military establishment.

A big majority of this shit is posted by bot accounts from other countries...but they do trick an awful lot of dumb shitty MAGAs into showing us just how dumb and shitty they are.

If you look at that page, it seems like it's nothing but a honeypot for getting Americans to fight each other. I haven't checked OP here's account. They may even be in on the game.

America's complete and utter reluctance to police propaganda in any way ruined this country for sure.

Post Title:      Comedian who mocked Renee Good days after her death sees all 6 of his sold-out shows canceled  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Ben Bankas, a Toronto\-born comedian now based in Austin, saw his run at Laugh Camp Comedy Club in St. Paul canceled after a video of his stand\-up set went viral, racking up more than eight million views. In the clip, filmed just days after Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Bankas joked about her death, saying, “Her last name was Good. That’s what I said after they shot her,” while also referring to Good’s wife as a “dog” and calling Good “retarded.”

This isn't justice served. The comedy club is going to have to pay the comedian his full contract or risk not being able to book any comedian repped by CAA. Comedian isn't going to lose anything and probably will end up gaining money through extra exposure and rebooking those dates at a different club.

here's the 'jokes' this Ben Bankas dullard told:

"Her last name was Good. That’s what I said after they shot her in the face"

“If she just took a bong toke before that excursion (she would have said) ‘I don’t know if we should go’,”

Ben also said that Renee “should have been shot 10 minutes before”.

Ben also called Renee Good's wife a "dumb, crazy retarded lesbian"

He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

The Epstein Files have made it pretty clear that the world is run by a cabal of pedo billionaires who buy and sell regular people like stocks. But sure, Trans people are the cause of society's problems because we want to use bathrooms and play sports. People need to stop dancing to this tune the elite play for us.

It's not just that trans women were a scapegoat distraction. Trans women and girls were specifically targeted and victimised sexually by a subset of the Epstein crowd, and the manufactured outrage was a engineered ploy to marginalise trans women and girls more, so that they would be easier to exploit

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
SCOTUS told the country there is only a single path forward to hold a sitting president accountable. Congress has to impeach him and remove him from office. There is no other way.

So until 67 Senators are on board with removal, he can do whatever he wants no matter what evidence of crimes comes to light.

He has the full support of way more than 33 Senators, and I can't foresee anything that will change that except elections. So we wait with our fingers crossed.

Edit: the thing we can do as citizens is pressuring our representatives in Congress. Let them know their own seat is at risk if they continue to support corruption and autocracy.

Ok. The american legal system is kind of a joke when it comes to prosecuting or stopping anyone above their Consumer\-class, though; and Trump doesn't seem like he's going to read their constitution anytime soon either

He's no authority to do half the things he does, but no\-one can stop him.

I wish the fuck lawyers would stop making fatuous comments like this, and do something substantive. And no, I haven't a fucking clue what, but I'm not a legal expert. They are.

Of course he doesn't. It's just another smoke screen. 

Something he can push now and then later when his side looses abysmally he can say "look I was right again!!" 

He has a child's mind and the wallet the size of a small nation.

Everything about him screams I am six years old and perfect in every way!

So tired of the way these things get reported on. Trump says something clearly illegal or unconstitutional: "Trump to do X," like it's a fait accompli, like he has the power to. Anyone who points out that it is illegal "Lawyers say it's unconstitutional." NO, the constitution says it is unconstitutional! It's not a matter for debate; it's literally spelled out word for word. This kind of headline writing erodes truth and makes it seem like these are issues that just have differing viewpoints to argue, like the tax rate on fish imports or something.

As a lawyer myself, I think it's adorable that lawyers believe that something so flimsy as "authority" can stop Trump from doing anything he wants. 

The guardrails that are supposed to stop his behavior are gone. The people who are supposed to stop him and enforce the rule of law refuse to act. 

There won't be elections this fall. One way or another, there won't be elections in the US.

Reddit fans do not want to address the cult problems with cult deprogramming, as that would remove the entertainment an amusements on Reddit that have become core to Reddit social gathering since June 16, 2015 ... **more than decade of Trump fandom gathering on Reddit social for the mockery and celebration of ignorance** via sarcasm-washing of Trump using Reddit commenting.

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Allegations are just words. Where is the actual evidence? Where is the actual person making the accusation (as opposed to the read out of what was recorded on an anonymous tip line)? How credible are those allegations?

It won't be possible to convict anyone based on an allegation. And an allegation alone isn't even enough for an indictment when it comes from an anonymous source or someone who won't actually testify in court or a sworn affidavit as to the allegation.

This is a lot of salacious nonsense. Not to throw a cold bucket of water on the JE stuff, because there is a lot there, but this is literally the stuff Biden's DOJ sorted through over the course of 4 years and found nothing that could be charged. 

The JE stuff is better out in the open (maybe?) because we can see that some public figures are distasteful in private, but being a misogynistic jerk in private emails isn't illegal. So why is the subreddit so obsessed with it? There are way more important things going on than the latest anonymous accusation against Trump from the 1990s. We know he's a bad person, so that isn't a revelation. If its just an unsubstantiated accusation, it isn't anything but words.

Wait a second. If Epstein has parties where girls are being trafficked in a backroom, every single person at that party is breaking the law just by being there, even if you're out front just dancing and enjoying the hors d'oeuvres? Can someone explain that please?

I respect that she used the word “girls” instead of trying to normalize their abuse and make it seem like they consented by calling them young women or women like so many right wing media outlets do. They were girls, children and they should be referred to as that so as to not lessen the deplorable crimes and the truly evil things these men have committed

I have empathy for her. I get the feeling she didn’t know the extent of how bad it was because Bill, like all slimey husbands, downplayed it but she found out, with the rest of us, just how bad it was until the leaks and file started to be released.

I am old enough to remember that in the 90s and early 00s Bill Gates was seen as an evil, vile, teat. He just had good PR in recent times. He was still the same slimeball.

On one hand I cannot blame these women for not saying stuff sooner and even now they aren’t really saying anything. It’s technically not their responsibility to answer for the men in their life. 

But Jesus fucking Christ how many couples are in these files where silence was complicity IN THE ABUSE OF CHILDREN. I just cannot imagine knowing my husband was raping children and being able to stomach it or be silent

Shocked that all the comments are mad at Melinda Gates and not…. The guy who was proven to be at Epstein’s Island? We don’t know if she knew or not, we don’t know how much she was allowed to say both from a safety and an NDA standpoint, and we don’t know that she didn’t say something to the FBI behind the scenes if she did find out before the public. 

I think people need to let up \- you don’t know what happened behind the scenes and why is it always a woman’s fault when a man behaves poorly?

Revelations should have never been included by the Bible. 

The Protestant obsession with (check notes) *clairvoyance* which goes directly against the rest of the Bible’s teachings is destroying Christianity. 

Not to mention the interpretation that revelations isn’t about the future but historical events.

How this is not bringing our country to an absolute grinding halt and us as a public (left or right) holding Trump and others accountable and press calling out Trump for such heinous shit, is beyond me. We are just going about our miserable lives while such a massive bomb of filth is exploding right in front of our faces. Yet the child rapist is sitting in the White House like it’s no big deal.

Edit: Wanted to add I wonder what mental contortions folks at [r/conservative](/r/conservative) are performing in order to spin this. Now that is TRUE TDS. Diaper Donny can do no wrong for them even if he rapes children. I am also sick of idiots who say shit like “oh it’s all just a fake wrestling match, behind the scenes they are all friends \-so let me do NOTHING while a child rapist lunatic burns my country down”

There are way, way too many people in this country that think this is not only fine but actually encourage it. Misogyny is a disease and this orange tumor is the symptom not the cause. We need a full generational reset about how we speak to one another as human beings.

The claims of fraud are completely without merit, over 60 lawsuits were tossed out by the courts in 2021, Trump lives in a fantasyland. In addition, the assertion that Johnson made that Republican states run their elections better than Democratic states is laughable.

Oh, fuck this fucking piece of shit. I legitimately dont know if I hate Johnson or trump more as government officials. These people have no place in public office.

And to be clear, it **doesn't** appear that way because it **didn't** happen. He has had 6 years to produce any shred of evidence that isn't his own fucking emotions or hurt feelings and only won an initial hearing ONE (1\) court case \- and then *still* did not follow through on providing evidence even after that minor procedural victory!

How long until the country understands that they were lulled to sleep by a narrative that the economy was bad when, in reality, it was actually doing perfectly fine? Yes, things are more expensive than they were in 2020, but that was the story literally everywhere, not just the United States. Trump is just making things worse by trying to play macroeconomics like a power game as opposed to just letting the markets operate as they should (tariffs are a form of government intervention in the economy, but some on the right will conveniently forget about that).

This is the concentration camp in Dilley, Texas. It's specifically where ICE/CBP sends the **children** they abduct. The place being on lockdown means that kids are confined to their cells/cages the entire day. Anyone who is OK with this should be on a list. Anyone who is perpetrating this is not fit or safe for the rest of society.

From a healthcare worker perspective:

people afraid of going to doctor with measles or to vaccinate \+ lock a ton of people in close quarters together (just need 1 to have measles, it's contagious 3\-5 days before rash shows up) \+ malnutrition since you don't feed them real food (which worsens measles outcomes) \= TF DID YOU EXPECT

People need to understand that Evangelicals don’t think Catholics are real Christian’s. Mike Johnson really thinks he knows more about the Bible than the pope because he legitimately thinks the Pope is going to hell for interpreting the Bible wrong.

If Mike Johnson wants to teach the Bible, he should start with the man in the Oval Office. The "Christian" who couldn't name a single Bible verse yet grifted believers by selling Trump Bibles.

The wild part isn’t that a US politician tried to correct the Pope. It’s that this is now a normal campaign move.

This is what happens when religion stops being about belief and starts being about dominance. Loud certainty beats actual knowledge, every time.

Republicans have absolutely NO policies to advance that would benefit America, so they resort to showmanship to deflect from their abysmal inability to lead.

I think its blackmail. They prove to all the powerful people involved, they do have the emails, and all they have to do is pull back a black rectangle and those peoples lives are over. Now the DOJ has essentially control over the whole world with every billionaire, prince, and corpo on a short leash.

They wouldn't be releasing this just because we demanded it. Since when have they listened to the demands of the people?

These fucks have completely dropped any pretense of wanting to participate in, or preserve a democracy \- they're the literal definition of traitors per their oaths to the Constitution. 

Absolutely pathetic \- rather than come up with a platform or policy people actually want, they'd rather drag America down into becoming a backwater failed authoritarian state, after obliterating the US economy and Dollar Trump has already lead to having its worst year *ever,* as countries have also ditched holding it in their reserves easily at record pace.

That’s the plan. ICE becomes election security in key districts. They can detain anyone they want under suspicion of being here illegally, including citizens. Hold them until after the polls close then release.

Edit: 

Dems should use the coming dhs shutdown to include a law preventing ice from operating near polling places when voting is happening, among other reforms …

Everyone in Trump's ponzi circle is feeling the heat lately. They know they'll lose majority and get prosecuted and impeached this year if no radical change happens until the midterms, and I think the American people are seriously done with their bullshittery. It's tiring to watch what's unfolding in the US even as a foreigner, I'd hate to think what's it like for the citizens themselves.

Post Title:      Steve Bannon proposes using ICE in elections  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
When you bring ICE anywhere near an election, it flips the whole vibe from “go vote, your voice matters” to “watch your back,” and that kills real democracy. People in mixed‑status families — which is millions of Americans — get spooked even if they are citizens, because nobody wants to risk their loved ones getting caught up in something. So instead of a normal, chill civic moment, you get fear, confusion, and folks staying home. 

And beyond that, using an immigration‑enforcement agency in a voting space makes it look like the government is trying to control who shows up, which breaks trust fast. 

Elections are supposed to feel open and neutral, not like you’re walking past a checkpoint. it’s a terrible idea — it messes with turnout, confidence, and the basic idea that everyone who’s eligible should be able to vote without feeling watched.

Immigration support is slipping, so pour on the fear of them stealing US elections, priming the pump for challenging their big losses. 

If Dems could steal elections, then explain how TF he won last time. Surely if we could rig votes he never would have gained office again. 

I don't believe polls show him with more than 505 support on ANY of his current schemes, but if Dems win, it must be rigged.

It’s not even hard to predict this stuff anymore. They will use ICE as a last resort.

They are going to fake the Fulton County results first, claim elections have no integrity, try and cancel the midterms, try and “nationalize” voting, try and rig the midterms, last resort is use ICE at the polls to intimidate and cause chaos

He's likely been a republican forever, but this tour\-de\-christ he's doing is so embarrassing and predictable. Everyone knows somebody who has extreme personal issues, either with depression/addiction/violence/etc, who THINKS they've pried themselves out of it and changed overnight because of the power of Jesus. They deal with none of the underlying issues, slap a cross on the wound and get to pretend that who they were was some alien creature. Who they were ALWAYS comes back. Violence, anger, addiction. Once the recent high of religion subsides they have to look at themselves again and it comes crashing down. Of course the MAGA\-verse are still susceptible to this in 2026, and too stupid to recognize the signs.

People should be talking about how fucking weird it is that the Vice President is pushing people to their own halftime show. It's bizarre. It’s arguably the largest American event that happens and they dont even want their supporters to partake in it. It is one of those things that in general it's not that big of a deal, but when you think about it it becomes bizarre. Why would the Vice President want to fracture culture like that, driving a wedge down our society. Why would the Vice President want their supporters to not actually see our culture but want them to only get a curated FOX version of it. The more you think about it, the weirder it gets. These people are not normal.

Post Title:      Kid Rock’s song about loving underage girls resurfaces ahead of TPUSA Super Bowl show  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
this is actually WHY the republicans like kid rock. It's the same with trump. It's not that the republicans like these idiots is spite of the fact that they're pedophiles, they like them specifically BECAUSE they are pedophiles. Republicans LOVE pedophiles because the ARE pedophiles.

So pointing a republican pedophile out to a republican is pointless, they already know, that's why they like them.

TPUSA didn’t just hire kid rock because he sings about being a pedophile, they also hired kid rock because he [likes to use the n word.](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/kid-rock-racial-slurs-waves-gun-rolling-stone-interview-1235687600/)

Well considering the cult he's part of, this tracks. It's probably WHY he was chosen. 

Nothing says "fuck you" to bad bunny like... blatant pedophilia?

Most right wingers don't have a shred of media literacy. They've never tried to understand the lyrics of the song, they just drunkenly belt out the chorus while driving the wrong way on the interstate.

By the way, Bruce Spingsteen did an 8\-Part Podcast with Barack Obama in 2021\. I suspect most right wingers don't know that either.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
The supposedly liberally\-biased mainstream media in the entire run\-up to the 2024 election:

“Trump is a 34\-time convicted felon, a convicted sexual criminal with a history of predatory behavior, a failed businessman only kept afloat by inherited wealth, an increasingly open xenophobe and racist who rode a wave of white grievance to power, a wannabe authoritarian who promises to rule as a dictator on day one, who presided over the most incompetent and corrupt presidential administration in the nation’s history which ran out any member with the least bit of integrity and oversaw the country’s geopolitical standing plummet and surrender our role of world leadership to China and Russia, who has shown a proclivity to weaponize the institutions of government against his perceived enemies and has a contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law, and, most importantly, orchestrated an attempted coup when it was clear that he lost the last election.

But Biden is old (a whole three years older than Trump!) so they’re both equally bad choices.”

Edit: Oh, and how can I forget Trump overseeing the incoherent and ineffective response to the COVID\-19 pandemic in its first months that possibly led to the deaths of, what, 500,000 Americans?

It’s worse than disappearing they’re debating about it major news networks. Instead of just dismissing it out of hand for what it is they’re parading out pundits to weigh the pros and cons and fascist dictatorship.

Trump can't read, nor has anyone provided him with an appropriate picture book on the subject.

> Post submitter, top-upvoted comment. Cover-fire for Trump. Kremlin "playing dumb" with Tweet-think Twitter-length short messaging to prime Reddit fandom that Trump is not a threat and harmless. Downplaying Putin's puppet as a danger to society. Downplaying Dr. Bandy X Lee's public education. This is the cool-down period for the audience before the next surge of chaos. Signaling the audience that Trump is a dunce and idiot and moron and nobody is smarter than Trump that is pushing the Reddit messaging signals since March 2013. Surkov won. The "can not read" resonates so much with Reddit fandom. Interpretation, comprehension, understanding, **nonfiction serious book authors** and pro-Malala mindsets are avoided in favor of setting an incredibly low bar of Trump mocking, right into the hands of Surkov students total mockery media culture.

The current president, a former president, the richest man in the world, the former richest man in the world, and many more are prominently featured in these files and the mainstream media *just doesn't really care*. They should be scouring those files and shining a spotlight on what should be the greatest scandal in world history that reveals shocking excesses and moral rot at the very center of the American power structure.

"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that thing down."
\- Todd Akin (R\-MO)

\- Rick Santorum (R\-PA)

"Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen."

"In the emergency room they have what's called rape kits, where a woman can get cleaned out."
\- Jodie Laubenberg (R\-TX)

"If a woman has (the right to an abortion), why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?
At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't (in most cases) result in anyone's death."

Yeah and thing is he probably still feels that way. Either way, republicans excuse literally anything and everything their leaders or people they admire do. Just like when Trump made his grab\-em\-by\-the\-pussy remark, and the one where he said he could walk down 5th avenue and just shoot someone and his base would still vote for him etc. Twisted mentalities.

The manager of the Grand Rapids (Michigan) Griffins posted publicly yesterday that he was going to watch Kid Rock instead of Bad Bunny because of bad lyrics, mentioning his young family.

You know that monolingual motherfker and his monolingual children haven't the faintest idea what Bad Bunny is saying. 

Hypocrites. All around.

Fox News HDTV was an issue since year 1996 that Reddit community can not intelligently discuss. Rupert Murdoch Fox News, **ONE YEAR after this 1995 nonfiction difficult articulate verbose book** was published:
> 
> * “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

> Posting title: "He is acting", yes, they are all acting to Surkov screenplays. Using the White House media systems to deliver content to Reddit hate-watching fandoms. Reddit is entirely not self-aware of this. Reddit people think they are resisting when they are doing exactly as conditioned by Kremlin and White House since March 2013. Surkov won. JD Vance is playing the every-popular bad guy character, like Walter White in Breaking Bad, and Reddit end-users eat this shit-show Reality TV White House up!

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

The Reddit users spend all their free time and spare time commenting about Trump's baby-making sex life and his death, life and death making, and not promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership on mental health problems. Why isn't Reddit audience turning to nonfiction books and a woman leader of intelligence and education?

It's helpful to think of MAGA supporters as computer programs with a very simple instruction set: "Say or do something that will cause emotional distress or physical harm to liberals". Their actual thoughts or beliefs don’t factor into what they say and do.

The state I lived in had to raise the minimum age to get married to 16 about a hundred and sixty days ago. Republicans fought it every step of the way. In 2023 [Sen. Mike Moon got on TV and said with his whole chest he wants to marry 12 year old kids.](https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/12/sen-mike-moon-reiterates-support-for-12-year-olds-right-to-marry-missouri-senate/70107573007/) It's all of them. All republicans are pedophiles and nobody is going to convince me otherwise.

They've always been the worst people of society they joined together as a team to stand against their betters (liberals) who have always rightfully looked down on them for the malignantly stupid or maliciously bad things they said. Now because we're attacking some of their team they have to defend them because they can't let their betters have the high ground AGAIN
