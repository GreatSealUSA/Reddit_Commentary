Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.." then the IRA in Q2 2013. Then Donald Trump's private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013. Then December 20, 2013 publican in English language of the global movement https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ then February 20, 2014 the Ukraine war started.

> Reddit users suffer from such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they are left feeling that this Russia-USA self-harm to the world is going very fast, but it is not as rapid as people think. The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki favoring of low-effort commenting, users of Reddit are all on different pages of ideas. Scattered, fragmented mindsets. The long-term shifts to anti-empathy pro-war anti-compassion pro-terrorism police state values and wrecking of NATO was in stages. Trump being removed from office and replaced by Joe Biden for 4 years slowed the progress down slightly.

They end up... sort of checklist of stuff they want to achieve. Sort of a strategy in the sense of.. this is where we want the country to be in 20 years time." - December 5, 2014

If you are focused on protecting girls, why isn't what Putin is doing to abduct and indoctrinate children into private affairs not discussed? Epstein had an island, but Putin has an entire military capturing children and terrorizing children. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war Are you ignorant of the sex trade and systemic rape abuse of girls in Russia?

The title of the Reddit media posting "immediately taint", no - this is how you OWN, win hearts and minds, using hate-watching audiences (Reddit and Bluesky are hate-watching fandoms of MAGA).

My wife’s family in Jalisco in a town outside of Guadalajara is saying that all schools are closed, all businesses are closed and everyone is sheltering in place. There a lot of burnings in the area. Her aunt is pretty scared. I always got teased by my in laws about being scared to travel to Mexico but if half the country is one dead cartel leader away from going up in smoke…

Edit: I should clarify we do not live in Mexico. My wife is Mexican and has family in Mexico and has been in contact with them over the past 24 hours.

Fallujah is a fairly isolated city, and had a total estimate of less than 4,000 enemy combatants, just dug in.

The CJNG on the other hand, has \~30,000 active members spread widely over 23 of Mexico's 31 states.

Seems like this isn't a good comparison: A single battle during a decades long war... vs the kickoff of a brand new conflict (or at least a new phase of an ongoing conflict) spanning most of a country.

I remember seeing a talk show with both Tim Allen and Queen Latifah in their prime. They were talking about the idea of "the man." And Tim just kept saying "But there isn't a *man*. What man? Where is this man?" And Queen Latifah was trying to explain that it was an idea of an authoritative figure \- it wasn't about any particular man, it could even be a woman. It's just a phrase for an idea. Tim just kept saying "But what man? Where does he live, this man? There is no 'the man.'"

It was then that I realized Tim Allen is just astonishingly dim\-witted.

The guy on the tv is Kash Patel, current head of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (our main national law enforcement agency). He recently used taxpayer money to fly to Italy and party with the men’s hockey team after they won gold in the Olympics. He has previously received a lot of criticism for being terrible at his job and hindering criminal investigations.

The woman is Nancy Guthrie, an American woman who was abducted from her home recently. The case is getting a lot of media attention and she has not been found. The joke is that he is prioritizing drinking and partying in another country rather than actually doing his job.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
For those asking why not arrest the guy? He was probably arrested after that beat down. Also, people have been growing frustrated lately. The indian court is corrupt. Just some examples:

1. An heir to a big builder killed two people while speeding in a Porsche while drunk. The court let him off and his only punishment was to write and submit an essay to the court.
2. The Indian court assigns judges that the current judges recommend. So majority of judges all belong to select few families.
3. A judge's house burnt down and around 5 crore rupees were found inside his house( around a million USD). The judiciary investigated it and found no wrong doing.
4. Bails have become extremely common. Even for the most heinous crimes, it is common to quickly get a bail.
5. The courts take too long to pass a judgement. In India, the lawyers are paid per court appearance( not per case), so it is in their best interest to drag court cases and it is too easy for them to do so. A personal anecdote I have is that, in one case lawyers on both sides came to the court after a year or so, both sides told the judge it's been a while so they need to recheck the documents and got the date pushed forward.

And finally it is a crime to criticize the judiciary as it is considered as "contempt of court"

Because he might be innocent. How would you know it isn't just the cops beating someone they dislike? 

Due proces is important...

We literally all booked it as soon as warrant put down his coffee.

Warrant Officers basically make their own rules. The paper says they are under Officers, but in reality these guys know more than everyone else. They are true experts in their fields. They also can skip PT and put their hands in their pockets. They are that powerful. Also don't have to show up to work most of the time.
