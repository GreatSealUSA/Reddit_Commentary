Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.." then the IRA in Q2 2013. Then Donald Trump's private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013. Then December 20, 2013 publican in English language of the global movement https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ then February 20, 2014 the Ukraine war started.

> Reddit users suffer from such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they are left feeling that this Russia-USA self-harm to the world is going very fast, but it is not as rapid as people think. The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki favoring of low-effort commenting, users of Reddit are all on different pages of ideas. Scattered, fragmented mindsets. The long-term shifts to anti-empathy pro-war anti-compassion pro-terrorism police state values and wrecking of NATO was in stages. Trump being removed from office and replaced by Joe Biden for 4 years slowed the progress down slightly.

They end up... sort of checklist of stuff they want to achieve. Sort of a strategy in the sense of.. this is where we want the country to be in 20 years time." - December 5, 2014

The title of the Reddit media posting "immediately taint", no - this is how you OWN, win hearts and minds, using hate-watching audiences (Reddit and Bluesky are hate-watching fandoms of MAGA).

My wife’s family in Jalisco in a town outside of Guadalajara is saying that all schools are closed, all businesses are closed and everyone is sheltering in place. There a lot of burnings in the area. Her aunt is pretty scared. I always got teased by my in laws about being scared to travel to Mexico but if half the country is one dead cartel leader away from going up in smoke…

Edit: I should clarify we do not live in Mexico. My wife is Mexican and has family in Mexico and has been in contact with them over the past 24 hours.

Fallujah is a fairly isolated city, and had a total estimate of less than 4,000 enemy combatants, just dug in.

The CJNG on the other hand, has \~30,000 active members spread widely over 23 of Mexico's 31 states.

Seems like this isn't a good comparison: A single battle during a decades long war... vs the kickoff of a brand new conflict (or at least a new phase of an ongoing conflict) spanning most of a country.

I remember seeing a talk show with both Tim Allen and Queen Latifah in their prime. They were talking about the idea of "the man." And Tim just kept saying "But there isn't a *man*. What man? Where is this man?" And Queen Latifah was trying to explain that it was an idea of an authoritative figure \- it wasn't about any particular man, it could even be a woman. It's just a phrase for an idea. Tim just kept saying "But what man? Where does he live, this man? There is no 'the man.'"

It was then that I realized Tim Allen is just astonishingly dim\-witted.

The guy on the tv is Kash Patel, current head of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (our main national law enforcement agency). He recently used taxpayer money to fly to Italy and party with the men’s hockey team after they won gold in the Olympics. He has previously received a lot of criticism for being terrible at his job and hindering criminal investigations.

The woman is Nancy Guthrie, an American woman who was abducted from her home recently. The case is getting a lot of media attention and she has not been found. The joke is that he is prioritizing drinking and partying in another country rather than actually doing his job.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
For those asking why not arrest the guy? He was probably arrested after that beat down. Also, people have been growing frustrated lately. The indian court is corrupt. Just some examples:

1. An heir to a big builder killed two people while speeding in a Porsche while drunk. The court let him off and his only punishment was to write and submit an essay to the court.
2. The Indian court assigns judges that the current judges recommend. So majority of judges all belong to select few families.
3. A judge's house burnt down and around 5 crore rupees were found inside his house( around a million USD). The judiciary investigated it and found no wrong doing.
4. Bails have become extremely common. Even for the most heinous crimes, it is common to quickly get a bail.
5. The courts take too long to pass a judgement. In India, the lawyers are paid per court appearance( not per case), so it is in their best interest to drag court cases and it is too easy for them to do so. A personal anecdote I have is that, in one case lawyers on both sides came to the court after a year or so, both sides told the judge it's been a while so they need to recheck the documents and got the date pushed forward.

And finally it is a crime to criticize the judiciary as it is considered as "contempt of court"

Warrant Officers basically make their own rules. The paper says they are under Officers, but in reality these guys know more than everyone else. They are true experts in their fields. They also can skip PT and put their hands in their pockets. They are that powerful. Also don't have to show up to work most of the time.

There were always an important euroskeptical sentiment among the Brits and it seems that company tipped enough the balance in favor of Brexit.

Calling for a ceasefire or advocating for Palestinian human rights should not cost someone their career. The fact that people are being punished or silenced for expressing that view raises serious concerns. Like the BBC censoring "Free Palestine".

Unsure the truth as separate article says the killer turned herself in and had previously refused DNA testing. Original post seems weird as DNA testing has been around for a long time…

[https://amp.scmp.com/news/people\-culture/article/3331605/japan\-man\-rents\-wifes\-murder\-flat\-20\-years\-preserve\-crime\-scene\-spends\-us145000](https://amp.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3331605/japan-man-rents-wifes-murder-flat-20-years-preserve-crime-scene-spends-us145000)

“His hopes were finally realised when the suspect gave herself up to police in Nagoya, central Japan. She was the man’s classmate at secondary school and had a crush on him.”

This article says same thing. She confessed after being anxious for decades. She had previously refused to provide DNA sample. Only after she confessed did she allow DNA sample which they matched (… they already had the DNA from the scene from decades ago).

> Gaza topic. Most popular most-upvoted comment. Under 140 characters, 5 words Twitter-thinking. Donald Trump has a blatant disregard for humanism because he considered is non-entertaining and boring. War is media content Trump and Reddit community all find attractive. It gives Trump something to give speeches, make statements about that's exciting like fireworks and thunderstorms. It gives Reddit media addicts a chance to put in their 5-word comments and upvote them to the top concern on the topic. Trump is a media addict who has the same common behaviors as Reddit users: AVOIDING SERIOUS NONFICTION RELEVANT BOOKS. Such as a year 2013 book of nonfiction that Reddit does not find relevant, nor does Trump.

They aren't melting down, they just haven't gotten their talking points yet. They will have their mental gymnastics routine ready by mid day on justifying this action as still fitting in with dear leader's "No New Wars" false claims.

Why is Jen Senko not mentioned when Fox News HDTV media Rupert Murdoch billionaire platform comes up? Why is a woman, Jen Senko, not promoted about the topic of Fox News? DO YOU SEE THE AVOIDANCE OF NONFICTION? The constant engagement of low-effort commenting on Reddit?

I mean if you look at how Israel has systematically assassinated high profile leaders and targets in the past years during their conflicts, every single time people ask "how the fuck". Iran knew how vulnerable their leadership is, hence they prepared beforehand for successors in case of death.

Random background character here. Dudes who usually “where my hug at?” are usually subtly ‘begging’ or asking for a hug from girls who hug everyone else when they’re leaving a social event apart from them. They usually don’t get the hug because they are perceived to be weird/undesirable in one way or another. The “look at how small my hands are” are usually deemed as “pick me” girls, trying to overtly portray their “cuteness” and overall femininity to garner male attention.

I think it's a good time to share this letter from author KA Applegate about the conclusion of her series the Animorphs, which the primary theme of was war. Bolded by me, and spoilers for the series.

> Quite a number of people seem to be annoyed by the final chapter in the Animorphs story. There are a lot of complaints that I let Rachel die. That I let Visser Three/One live. That Cassie and Jake broke up. That Tobias seems to have been reduced to unexpressed grief. That there was no grand, final fight\-to\-end\-all\-fights. That there was no happy celebration. And everyone is mad about the cliffhanger ending.

> Animorphs was always a war story. Wars don’t end happily. Not ever. Often relationships that were central during war, dissolve during peace. Some people who were brave and fearless in war are unable to handle peace, feel disconnected and confused. Other times people in war make the move to peace very easily. Always people die in wars. And always people are left shattered by the loss of loved ones.
> 
> **That’s what happens, so that’s what I wrote. Jake and Cassie were in love during the war, and end up going their seperate ways afterward. Jake, who was so brave and capable during the war is adrift during the peace. Marco and Ax, on the other hand, move easily past the war and even manage to use their experience to good effect. Rachel dies, and Tobias will never get over it. That doesn’t by any means cover everything that happens in a war, but it’s a start.**
> 
> **Here’s what doesn’t happen in war: there are no wondrous, climactic battles that leave the good guys standing tall and the bad guys lying in the dirt. Life isn’t a World Wrestling Federation Smackdown. Even the people who win a war, who survive and come out the other side with the conviction that they have done something brave and necessary, don’t do a lot of celebrating. There’s very little chanting of ‘we’re number one’ among people who’ve personally experienced war.**
> 
> I’m just a writer, and my main goal was always to entertain. But I’ve never let Animorphs turn into just another painless video game version of war, and I wasn’t going to do it at the end. I’ve spent 60 books telling a strange, fanciful war story, sometimes very seriously, sometimes more tongue\-in\-cheek. I’ve written a lot of action and a lot of humor and a lot of sheer nonsense. But I have also, again and again, challenged readers to think about what they were reading. To think about the right and wrong, not just the who\-beat\-who. And to tell you the truth I’m a little shocked that so many readers seemed to believe I’d wrap it all up with a lot of high\-fiving and backslapping. Wars very often end, sad to say, just as ours did: with a nearly seamless transition to another war.
> 
> **So, you don’t like the way our little fictional war came out? You don’t like Rachel dead and Tobias shattered and Jake guilt\-ridden? You don’t like that one war simply led to another? Fine. Pretty soon you’ll all be of voting age, and of draft age. So when someone proposes a war, remember that even the most necessary wars, even the rare wars where the lines of good and evil are clear and clean, end with a lot of people dead, a lot of people crippled, and a lot of orphans, widows and grieving parents.**

Iranian here. 

For those wondering how the leader of a country of nearly 90 million could be taken out so easily, the reality is that he ruled a nation where millions despised his regime. He lived hidden away in secrecy, surrounded by paranoia, because the government knew how deeply unpopular it had become.

When a regime spends decades imprisoning its people, beating its women, and crushing dissent, loyalty eventually disappears. Many inside Iran have long wanted this system gone.

Look at Iranian news outlets and social media, millions of people are already pouring into the streets, expressing emotions the world has rarely been allowed to see.

Good news for IRGC and regime leadership though: surprise off\-cycle promotions!

Downsides: job is very stressful and there's high turnover.

...this is the same BBC that is "peddling unverified claims" from Trump and Netanyahu that Khamenei was killed. It's called journalism and they are reporting on what is being said by various groups and clearly state the claims have not been independently verified.

Perhaps the race for the scoop is just too much in this day and age and everyone should just wait for verification before publishing

I wondered how long it would take before the first story of a school or a wedding getting bombed would be published.
