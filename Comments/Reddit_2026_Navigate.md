* "we are now on one side of the pyramid. We've moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of **one side of an argument**. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason." - https://www.GreatSealUSA.com Published Year 1988.
