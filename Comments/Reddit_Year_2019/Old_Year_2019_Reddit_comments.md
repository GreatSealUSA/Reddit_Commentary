On a topic of Russian interference, the reply "Stfu lol" in social media website comments.

Published August 12, 2014:

*Russia\-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag.com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self\-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion."*

*"If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article* ***that's critical of Russia,*** *and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12\-year\-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.*

*"You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds. "Those kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate, and they work."*

Trivializing science, progress, and understanding with banality is what Rick Roderick deserves the most credit for describing as a unique USA behavior.

Jean Baudrillard did not include that in HyperReality theory directly, and Roderick in his 7\-hour concept mentioned it was his own personal addition to the theory. France to USA.

Adam Curtis emphasized "Normalization", closer, but still not the taste of dismissive MEME memorization that the USA has turned almost all society conversations into via mobile\-phone media consumption. UK to USA.

Hyper Banality, the trivialization of everything important, is the heart of the Surkov media siege. To also build peer pressure, crowd, cheering, when a bully beats\-up a nerd with banality thinking and dismissals. 

*And I mean, you know, we see other people engaging in this same, sort of, attempting to reduce complexity. I mean, the political parties, to the extent that they exist at all anymore as anything other than fund raising devices, which I don’t know. I don’t think they have any ideologies because in a postmodern situation who would have an ideology except just as a momentary thing? Like your “Week as a Communist” by Suzie Saint Pierre at Duke \[crowd laughter], “My Week as a Trotskyist”, “My Week as a Buddhist”, “My Two Weeks as a Follower of the Cult of Elvis”, I mean, these are papers that you could legitimately expect people to write if they still read or wrote. Not many people still do either – read or write, much – but in any case; reduction of complexity.*

*Let’s look at political parties for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”.*

Why would you push all this banality? People often assert that Russia doing this can't be true, as it doesn't fit with classic advertising of Coke vs. Pepsi where you want to increase sales of the product.

This is a widespread attack on truth, fact, reason, leveling minds out before leaders just do as they please without resistance.

Published September 9, 2014: *The point of this new propaganda is not to persuade anyone, but to keep the viewer hooked and distracted—to disrupt Western narratives rather than provide a counternarrative.*

If you can observe people cheer that a TV show episode said "Fuck" 7 times in one hour, and the previous record was only 4 times \- they are tapping into that banality desire. And you keep feeding them their ego desire until the brain chemistry enjoys the *tone and style* of interpretation more than "hard cold truth". The kind of thing Fox News and Rush Limbaugh does, but even more so \- as Surkov is tapping into the MonoMyth layer, even deeper.

The Hyper Banlity I think serves several purposes, but it also clears the mind to seek out coherency. But unrooted coherency, meaning fresh "washed" brain able to accept fresh world view.

That is why I emphasize so much: Rick Roderick 1993, Great Seal 1776, Joseph Campbell \- who died in 1987, Second Bill of Rights from 75 years ago, and Martin Luther King Jr who died in 1968\.

What is "good" when people are so in engaged with thousands of echo\-chamber alternate realities? Campbell being the one to articulate that when all sides misinterpret their mythology.

WHAT is the Complex that is given when minds are reset with banality noise tone?

Reddit has become a banality satiation platform, brain chemistry repetition platform. The resignation today of Theresa May has lead to

</r/HighQualityGifs>  
</r/FakeHistoryPorn>

Others making the front page mixing popular TV and other banality with a serious topic. People are not talking about lessons learned, how to improve the UK \- instead, they are getting a chemical brain pleasure from mocking and parroting the "bad leader". They are spectators, not citizens in multiple democracies ideals \- as mocking and insulting is now more important to their lives than democracy. This mocking is all they seem to need to stay glued to the simulation spectacle as described by Rick Roderick in 1993\.

It might be funny if there wasn't examples of humans in the Middle East engaged in meme\-mocking to a point of total society extrusion of science, progress, and earnestness. It is not funny, and in fact Rick Roderick explains how this is self\-dehumanizing and self\-destructive behavior. As does David Foster Wallace in various works. Surkov is a master, and Adam Curtis emphasizes normalizing dehumanization (HyperNormalisation by Surkov in 2016 film) \- which I have in 2019 emphasized what Roderick called out *banalization via media*.

I think the out\-group rejection described by Joseph Campbell regarding the Middle East conflicts over competing MonoMyth thinking/education/parenting media patterns will find Roderick correct that "LOL of serious dehumanizing topics" is in fact a Mass Mind (Howard Bloom, August 2000 term) exploit.

Weaponized Absurdity Kremlin Media Tactic \_ Reddit Comment

Published 2014: *But insisting on the lie, the Kremlin intimidates others by showing that it is in control of defining ‘reality.’ This is why it’s so important for Moscow to do away with truth. If nothing is true, then anything is possible. We are left with the sense that we don’t know what Putin will do next—that he’s unpredictable and thus dangerous. We’re rendered stunned, spun, and flummoxed by the Kremlin’s weaponization of absurdity and unreality.*
